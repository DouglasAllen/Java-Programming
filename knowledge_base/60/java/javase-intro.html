<h1>Introduction to Developing General Java Applications</h1>

<p>The following short tutorial takes you through some of the basic steps of developing
  a Java SE application in NetBeans IDE 6.0. 
  This tutorial assumes you already have some familiarity with developing Java applications. 
  Along the way, we will demonstrate some of the IDE features that simplify application 
  development.</p>
  <p>We will be developing an application that converts several words into a 
  single word that contains one letter from the other words. The resulting 
  word is composed of the first letter of the first word, the second letter of 
  the second word, the third letter of the third word, and so on. The 
  resulting word is called an <i>acrostic</i>.</p>

<h2>Project Setup<a name="setup"></a></h2>
 <p>The application we create will contain two projects:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>A Java library project with a utility class.</li>
  <li>A Java application project with a main class that implements
  a method from the library project.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> Strictly speaking, two projects are not needed for such a simple 
    application. We are merely using two projects to demonstrate features that you 
    might need for a more complex application.
</p>

<p>First we will create a new Java class library to contain the utility classes
  we will need later. Then we need to create a new Java application to use as our
  main project. Once the MyApp project has been created, we'll add MyLib's classes
  to its classpath. </p>
  <!--TODO describe acrostic-->
<div class="indent">
    <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="setup-library">Creating a New Java Class Library</a></h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Choose File &gt; New Project (Ctrl-Shift-N). Under Categories, select
      Java. Under Projects, select Java Class Library and click Next. </li>
    <li>Under Project Name, enter <tt>MyLib</tt>. Change the Project Location
      to any directory on your computer. From now on, we will refer to this directory
      as <tt><i>NetBeans_projects</i></tt>.
      <p><b>Note:</b> The path specified above should appear as follows in 
      the Project Folder field of the wizard: <code>/<tt><i>NetBeans_projects</i></tt>/MyLib/</code>
    </li>
    <li>Click Finish. The MyLib project opens in both the Projects window and
      the Files window.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="setup-application">Creating a New Java Application</a></h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Choose File &gt; New Project. Under Categories, select Java. Under
      Projects, select Java Application and click Next.</li>
    <li>Under Project Name, enter <tt>MyApp</tt>. Make sure the Project Location
      is set to <tt><i>NetBeans_projects</i></tt>. </li>
    <li>Enter <tt>acrostic.Main</tt> as the main class. </li>
    <li>Ensure that the Set as Main Project and Create Main Class checkboxes are
      checked. </li>
    <li>Click Finish. The MyApp project is displayed in the Project window and
      <code>Main.java</code> opens in the Source Editor.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="setup-classpath">Configuring the Compilation Classpath</a></h3>
  
  <p>Since MyApp is going to depend on a class in MyLib, we have to add MyLib 
  to the classpath of MyApp. Doing so will also ensure that classes in the MyApp 
  project can refer to classes in the MyLib project without causing compilation 
  errors. In addition, this will enable you to use code completion in the MyApp 
  project to fill in code based on the MyLib project.</p>
<p><b>To add the library's utility classes to the project classpath:</b></p>
  <ol>
    <li>In the Projects window, right-click the Libraries node for the MyApp project
      and choose Add Project.</li>
    <li>Browse to <tt><i>NetBeans_projects</i>/</tt> and select the <tt>MyLib</tt>
      project folder. The Project JAR Files pane shows the JAR files that can
      be added to the project. Notice that a JAR file for MyLib is listed even
      though we have not actually built the JAR file yet. This JAR file will get
      built when we build and run the MyApp project. </li>
    <li>Click Add Project JAR Files.</li>
    <li>Expand the Libraries node. The MyLib project's JAR file is added
      to the MyApp project's classpath. </li>
  </ol>
</div>
<!-- =============================================================================== -->
<h2>Creating and Editing Java Source Code<a name="create"></a></h2>
<p>Now we need to create a Java package and add the method that we'll use to construct
  our acrostic, after which we'll implement the <tt>acrostic</tt> method in the
  <tt>Main</tt> class. </p>
<div class="indent">
  <h3 class="tutorial">Creating a Java Package and Class File</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Right-click the MyLib project node and choose New &gt; Java Class. Type
      <tt>LibClass</tt> as the name for the new class, type <tt>org.me.mylib</tt>
      in the Package field, and click Finish. <tt>LibClass.java</tt> opens in
      the Source Editor.
    </li>
    <li>In <tt>LibClass.java</tt>, place the cursor on the line after the class
      declaration (<code>public class LibClass {</code>.</li>
<li>Type or paste in the following method code: </li>
    <pre class="examplecode">    public static String acrostic(String[] args) {
        StringBuffer b = new StringBuffer();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; args.length; i++) {
            if (args[i].length() &gt; i) {
                b.append(args[i].charAt(i));
            } else {
                b.append('?');
            }
        }
        return b.toString();
    }</pre>
    <li>If the code you pasted in is not formatted correctly, press Alt-Shift-F
      to reformat the entire file.</li>
    <!--note: reformat doesn't work for mac-->
    <li>Press Ctrl-S to save the file.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 class="tutorial">Editing a Java File</h3>
  <p>Now we will add some code to <tt>Main.java</tt>. In doing so, 
  we will demonstrate the Source Editor's code completion and 
  code template (abbreviation) features.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Select the <tt>Main.java</tt> tab in the Source Editor. If it isn't already
      open, expand MyApp &gt; Source Packages &gt; acrostic in the Projects window and double-click
      <tt>Main.java</tt>. </li>
    <li>Delete the <tt>// TODO code application logic here</tt> comment in the
      <tt>main</tt> method.</li>
<li>In place of the comment type the following:
      <pre class="examplecode">String result = Li</pre>
      <p>Leave the cursor immediate after <tt>Li</tt>. In the next step we will 
      show how to use code completion to turn <tt>Li</tt> into <tt>LibClass</tt>.      
    </li>
    <li>Press Ctrl-Space to open 
        the code completion box. 
    <p>A short list of possible ways to complete the word appears. 
However, the class that you want, <tt>LibClass</tt> might not there.</p></li>
    <li>Press Ctrl-Space again to display a longer list of possible matches.
    <p><tt>LibClass</tt> should be in this list.</p></li>
        <li>Select <tt>LibClass</tt> and press Enter. The
      IDE fills in the rest of the class name and also automatically creates an
      import statement for the class. 
        <p><b>Note:</b> The IDE also opens a box above the code completion box that
            displays Javadoc information for the selected class or package. Since there
            is no Javadoc information for most packages, the box displays a &quot;Cannot
    find Javadoc message&quot; until you reach a Java class.</p></li>
    <li>In the main method, enter a period after <tt>LibClass</tt>. The code
      completion box opens again.</li>
      <li>Select the <tt>acrostic(String[]args)</tt> method
      and press Enter. The IDE fills in the <tt>acrostic</tt> method and shows
      the highlights the <tt>args</tt> parameter. </li>
    <li>Press Enter to accept <tt>args</tt> as the parameter.</li>
    <li>Type a semicolon. 
        <p>The final
      line should look like this:</p>
      <pre class="examplecode">String result = LibClass.acrostic(args);</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Press Enter to start a new line. Then type <tt>sout</tt> and press Tab.
      The <tt>sout</tt> abbreviation expands to <tt>System.out.println(&quot;&quot;);
      </tt>with the cursor positioned between the quotation marks. Type <tt>Result
      =</tt> inside the quotation marks and <tt>+ result</tt> after the end quotation
      mark. The final line should look like this:
      <pre class="examplecode">System.out.println(&quot;Result = &quot; + result);</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Press Ctrl-S to save the file.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
<h2>Compiling and Running the Project<a name="comp"></a></h2>
<p>Now we need to set the main class and execution arguments so we can run our
  project. We'll also take a look at the IDE's cleaning, building, and Javadoc
  generation features. </p>
<div class="indent">
  <h3 class="tutorial">Setting the Main Class and Execution Arguments</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Right-click the MyApp project node, choose Properties, and select the
      Run node in the dialog's left pane. Notice that the main class is already
      set to <tt>acrostic.Main</tt>.</li>
    <li>Enter <tt>However&nbsp;we&nbsp;all&nbsp;feel&nbsp;zealous </tt>in
      the Arguments field and click OK.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 class="tutorial">Running the Main Project</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Choose Run&nbsp;&gt; Run&nbsp;Main&nbsp;Project (F6) from the Run menu.</li>
    <li>Double-click the Output window to maximize it so you can see all the output.
      Note that Ant builds <tt>MyLib.jar</tt> first and then compiles MyApp
      using it. Finally, it prints the output from the program, <tt>Result =
      Hello </tt> (the acrostic of the phrase that was passed to the program
      as an argument). </li>
    <li>Select the Files window and expand the MyApp project folder. The built
      class files are in the <tt>build</tt> folder. </li>
    <li>Press F6 to run the program again. Nothing new needs to be compiled, but
      the program is run.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 class="tutorial">Cleaning and Building the Project</h3>
  <p>If you build a project and then later change classes, it is good to remove 
  all build artifacts from your system and create a fresh build of the application. 
  You can do this with the Clean and Build command.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Choose Build &gt; Clean and Build Main Project (Shift-F11). Both the MyLib
      project and the MyApp project are cleaned and rebuilt as part of the process.
    </li>
    <li>Right-click the MyLib project node in the Projects window and choose Clean
      Project. Just the MyLib project is cleaned.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 class="tutorial">Building an Individual Project</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Right-click the MyLib project node in the Projects window.</li>
    <li>Choose Build Project from the contextual menu.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 class="tutorial">Generating Javadoc</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Select the MyLib project.</li>
    <li>Choose Build &gt; Generate&nbsp;Javadoc for&nbsp;"MyLib" from
      the IDE's main menu.
      <p>The IDE displays Javadoc output in the Output window, and your web browser
        opens displaying the Javadoc.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
<!-- =============================================================================== -->
<h2>Testing and Debugging the Project<a name="test"></a></h2>
<p>Now we'll create and run a test for our project using JUnit and then run it
  in the IDE's debugger to check for errors. In the JUnit test, we test the 
LibClass by passing a phrase to the <tt>acrostic</tt> method and using an assertion 
to indicate what we think the result should be.</p>
<div class="indent">
  <h3 class="tutorial">Creating JUnit Tests</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Right-click the <tt>LibClass.java</tt> node in the Projects window and
      choose Tools &gt;Create JUnit Tests (Ctrl-Shift-U). 
      <p>If this is the first time you have created JUnit tests in the IDE, you 
      will be prompted with the Select JUnit Version dialog box. Press Enter to 
      select JUnit 4.x and continue to the Create Tests dialog box.</p></li>
      <li>In the Create Tests dialog box, click OK
      to run the command with the default options. The IDE creates the <tt>org.me.mylib</tt>
      package and the <tt>LibClassTest.java</tt> file in a separate <tt>test</tt> folder. You can find this 
  file by expanding the Test Packages node and the <tt>org.me.mylib</tt> subnode.</li>
    <li>In <tt>LibClassTest.java</tt>, delete the body of
      the <tt>public void acrostic()</tt> method. </li>
<li>In place of the deleted lines, type or paste in the following:
      <pre class="examplecode">System.err.println(&quot;Running testAcrostic...&quot;);
String result = LibClass.acrostic(new String[]
                  {&quot;fnord&quot;, &quot;polly&quot;, &quot;tropism&quot;});
assertEquals(&quot;Correct value&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;, result);</pre>
    <li> Save the file by pressing Ctrl-S. </li>
  </ol>
  <h3 class="tutorial">Running JUnit Tests</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Select the MyLib project node and choose Run &gt; Test &quot;MyLib&quot;
      (Alt-F6). The<tt> MyLib&nbsp;(test)</tt> tab opens in the Output window.
      The JUnit test cases are compiled and run. The JUnit test result shows that
      the test passes. </li>
    <li>You can also run a single test file rather than testing the entire project.
      Select the <tt>LibClass.java</tt> tab in the Source Editor and choose Run
      &gt; Run File &nbsp;&gt; Test&nbsp;&quot;LibClass.java&quot; from the Run
      menu. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The JUnit API documentation is available from the IDE. Choose Help &gt; 
Javadoc References &gt; JUnit API.</p>
<p>You can learn more about JUnit by visiting 
  <a href="http://www.junit.org" target="_blank">  http://www.junit.org  </a>
<h3 class="tutorial">Debugging the Project</h3>
  <ol>
    <li> In the <tt>LibClass.java</tt> file, go to the <code>acrostic</code> method
      and place the insertion point anywhere inside <tt>b.append(args[i].charAt(i));</tt>.
      Then press Ctrl-F8 to set a breakpoint. </li>
    <li>Choose Run&nbsp;&gt; Debug Main Project (Ctrl-F5). The IDE opens the Debugger
      windows and runs the project in the debugger until the breakpoint is reached.
    </li>
    <li>Select the Local&nbsp;Variables window and expand the <tt>args</tt> node.
      The array of strings contains the phrase you entered as the command arguments.
    </li>
    <li>Click Step Into (F7) in the toolbar to step through the program and watch
      the acrostic being constructed.
      <p>When the program reaches the end, the debugger windows close.
    </li>
  </ol>
