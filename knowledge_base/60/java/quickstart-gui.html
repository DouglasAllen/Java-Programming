<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>The IDE's GUI Builder makes it possible to build professional-looking GUIs 
  without an intimate understanding of layout managers. You can lay out your forms 
  by simply placing components where you want them. </p>

  <h3 class="tutorial">Creating a Project </h3>
  <p>Because all Java development in the IDE takes place within projects, we first 
    need to create a new ContactEditor project within which to store sources and 
    other project files. An IDE project is a group of Java source files plus its 
    associated meta data, including project-specific properties files, an Ant 
    build script that controls the build and run settings, and a project.xml file 
    that maps Ant targets to IDE commands. While Java applications often consist 
    of several IDE projects, for the purposes of this tutorial, we will build 
    a simple application which is stored entirely in a single project. </p>
  <table width="91%">
    <tr> 
      <td>
        <p>To create a new ContactEditor application project: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Choose File &gt; New Project. Alternately, you can click the New 
            Project icon in the IDE toolbar. </li>
          <li>In the Categories pane, select the Java node and in the Projects 
            pane, choose Java Application. Click Next.</li>
          <li> Enter ContactEditor in the Project Name field and specify the project 
            location.</li>
          <li>Ensure that the Set as Main Project checkbox is selected and clear the  
            Create Main Class field. </li>
          <li>Click Finish. 
            <p>
              The IDE creates the <tt>ContactEditor</tt> folder on your system 
              in the designated location. This folder contains all of the project's 
              associated files, including its Ant script, folders for storing 
              sources and tests, and a folder for project-specific metadata. To 
              view the project structure, use the IDE's Files window. </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <a name="container"></a> 
  <h3 class="tutorial">Creating a GUI Container</h3>
  <p>After creating the new application, you may have noticed that the Source 
    Packages folder in the Projects window contains an empty <tt>&lt;default package&gt;</tt> 
    node. To proceed with building our interface, we need to create a Java container 
    within which we will place the other required GUI components. In this step 
    we'll create a container using the <tt>JFrame</tt> component and place the 
    container in a new package.</p>
  <table width="91%">
    <tr> 
      <td>
        <p>To create a JFrame container: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>In the Projects window, right-click the ContactEditor node and choose 
            New &gt; JFrame Form. </li>
          <li>Enter ContactEditorUI as the Class Name. </li>
          <li>Enter <tt>my.contacteditor</tt> as the package.</li>
          <li>Click Finish. 
            <p> The IDE creates the <tt>ContactEditorUI</tt> form and the <tt>ContactEditorUI</tt> 
              class within the <tt>ContactEditorUI.java</tt> application and opens 
              the <tt>ContactEditorUI</tt> form in the GUI Builder. Notice that 
              the <tt>my.contacteditor</tt> package replaces the default package. 
            </p>
          </li>

<h2>Getting Familiar with the GUI Builder</h2>
<p>Now that we've set up a new project for our application, let's take a minute 
  to familiarize ourselves with the GUI Builder's interface. To explore the GUI 
  Builder interface with an interactive demo, click the View Demo icon.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../../images/articles/quickstart-gui/01_gb_ui.png" alt="The IDE's GUI Builder Interface."></p>

  View Demo</a></p>
<p>When we added the JFrame container, the IDE opened the newly-created <tt>ContactEditorUI</tt> 
  form in an Editor tab with a toolbar containing several buttons, as shown in 
  the preceeding illustration. The ContactEditor form opened in the GUI Builder's 
  Design view and three additional windows appeared automatically along the IDE's 
  edges, enabling you to navigate, organize, and edit GUI forms as you build them. 
</p>
<p>The GUI Builder's various windows include: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Design Area. </b>The GUI Builder's primary window for creating and editing 
    Java GUI forms. The toolbar's Source and Design toggle buttons enable you 
    to view a class's source code or a graphical view of its GUI components. The 
    additional toolbar buttons provide convenient access to common commands, such 
    as choosing between Selection and Connection modes, aligning components, setting 
    component auto-resizing behavior, and previewing forms. </li>
  <li><b>Inspector. </b>Provides a representation of all the components, both 
    visual and non-visual, in your application as a tree hierarchy. The Inspector 
    also provides visual feedback about what component in the tree is currently 
    being edited in the GUI Builder as well as allows you to organize components 
    in the available panels. </li>
  <li><b>Palette. </b>A customizable list of available components containing tabs 
    for JFC/Swing, AWT, and JavaBeans components, as well as layout managers. 
    In addition, you can create, remove, and rearrange the categories displayed 
    in the Palette using the customizer. </li>
  <li><b>Properties Window. </b>Displays the properties of the component currently 
    selected in the GUI Builder, Inspector window, Projects window, or Files window. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If you click the Source button, the IDE displays the application's Java source 
  code in the Editor with sections of code that are automatically generated by 
  the GUI Builder indicated by blue areas, called Guarded Blocks. Guarded blocks 
  are protected areas that are not editable in Source view. You can only edit 
  code appearing in the white areas of the Editor when in Source view. If you 
  need to make changes to the code within a Guarded Block, clicking the Design 
  button returns the IDE's Editor to the GUI Builder where you can make the necessary 
  adjustments to the form. When you save your changes, the IDE updates the file's 
  sources. 
<p><b>Note:</b> For advanced developers, a Palette Customizer is available that 
  enables you to add custom components from JARs, libraries, or other projects 
  to the Palette. </p>

<a name="key_concepts"></a> 
<h2>Key Concepts</h2>
<p>The IDE's GUI Builder solves the core problem of Java GUI creation by streamlining 
  the workflow of creating graphical interfaces, freeing developers from the complexities 
  of Swing layout managers. It does this by extending the current NetBeans IDE 
  GUI Builder to support a straightforward "Free Design" paradigm with simple 
  layout rules that are easy to understand and use. As you lay out your form, 
  the GUI Builder provides visual guidelines suggesting optimal spacing and alignment 
  of components. In the background, the GUI Builder translates your design decisions 
  into a functional UI that is implemented using the new GroupLayout layout manager 
  and other Swing constructs. Because it uses a dynamic layout model, GUI's built 
  with the GUI Builder behave as you would expect at runtime, adjusting to accommodate 
  any changes you make without altering the defined relationships between components. 
  Whenever you resize the form, switch locales, or specify a different look and 
  feel, your GUI automatically adjusts to respect the target look and feel's insets 
  and offsets.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <h3 class="tutorial">Free Design</h3>
  <p>In the IDE's GUI Builder, you can build your forms by simply putting components 
    where you want them as though you were using absolute positioning. The GUI 
    Builder figures out which layout attributes are required and then generates 
    the code for you automatically. You need not concern yourself with insets, 
anchors, fills, and so forth. </p>
  <h3 class="tutorial">Automatic Component Positioning (Snapping)</h3>

  <p>As you add components to a form, the GUI Builder provides visual feedback 
    that assists in positioning components based on your operating system's look 
    and feel. The GUI Builder provides helpful inline hints and other visual feedback 
    regarding where components should be placed on your form, automatically snapping 
    components into position along guidelines. It makes these suggestions based 
    on the positions of the components that have already been placed in the form, 
    while allowing the padding to remain flexible such that different target look 
    and feels render properly at runtime.</p>
  <!--<h3 class="tutorial">Component Auto-Resizing</h3>-->
  <h3 class="tutorial">Visual Feedback </h3>
  <p>The GUI Builder also provides visual feedback regarding component anchoring 
    and chaining relationships. These indicators enable you to quickly identify 
    the various positioning relationships and component pinning behavior that 
    affect the way your GUI will both appear and behave at runtime. This speeds 
    the GUI design process, enabling you to quickly create professional-looking 
    visual interfaces that work.</p>

<a name="first_things"></a> 
<h2>First Things First</h2>
<!--was Adding Components-->
<p>Now that you have familiarized yourself with the GUI builder's interface, it's 
  time to begin developing the UI of our ContactEditor application. In this section 
  we'll take a look at using the IDE's Palette to add the various GUI components 
  that we need to our form. </p>
<p>Thanks to the IDE's Free Design paradigm, you no longer have to struggle 
  with layout managers to control the size and position of the components within 
  your containers. All you need to do is drag and drop (or pick and plop) the 
  components you need to your GUI form as shown in the illustrations that follow. 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <h3 class="tutorial">Adding Components: The Basics </h3>
  <!--was First Things First-->
  <p>Though the IDE's GUI Builder simplifies the process of creating Java GUIs, 
    it is often helpful to sketch out the way you want your interface to look 
    before beginning to lay it out. Many interface designers consider this a "best 
    practice" technique, however, for the purposes of this tutorial you can simply 
    peek at how our completed form should look by jumping ahead to the <a href="quickstart-gui.html#previewing_form">Previewing 
    your GUI </a>section. </p>
  <p>Since we've already added a JFrame as our form's top-level container, the 
    next step is to add a couple of JPanels which will enable us to cluster the 
    components of our UI using titled borders. Refer to the following illustrations 
    and notice the IDE's "pick and plop" behavior when accomplishing this. </p>
  <table width="91%">
    <tr> 
      <td>
        <p>To add a JPanel: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>In the Palette window, select the <tt>JPanel</tt> component from 
            the Swing category by clicking and releasing the mouse button.</li>
          <li>Move the cursor to the upper left corner of the form in the GUI 
            Builder. When the component is located near the container's top and 
            left edges, horizontal and vertical alignment guidelines appear indicating 
            the preferred margins. Click in the form to place the JPanel in this 
            location. </li>
          <p>The <tt>JPanel</tt> component appears in the <tt>ContactEditorUI</tt> 
            form with orange highlighting signifying that it is selected, as shown 
            in the following illustration. After releasing the mouse button, small 
            indicators appear to show the component's anchoring relationships 
            and a corresponding JPanel node is displayed in the Inspector window.</p>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <table align="center">
    <tr> 
      <td><img src="../../../images/articles/quickstart-gui/02_add_panels_1.png"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Next, we need to resize the JPanel to make room for the components we'll 
    place within it a little later, but let's take a minute to point out another 
    of the GUI Builder's visualization features first. In order to do this we 
    need to deselect the JPanel we just added. Because we haven't added a title 
    border yet, the panel disappears. Notice, however, that when you pass the 
    cursor over the JPanel, its edges change to light gray so that its position 
    can be clearly seen. You need only to click anywhere within the component 
    to reselect it and cause the resize handles and anchoring indicators to reappear.</p>
  <table width="91%">
    <tr> 
      <td>
        <p>To resize the JPanel:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Select the JPanel you just added. The small square resize handles 
            reappear around the component's perimeter.</li>
          <li>Click and hold the resize handle on the right edge of the JPanel 
            and drag until the dotted alignment guideline appears near the form's 
            edge.</li>
          <li>Release the resize handle to resize the component.</li>
          <p> The <tt>JPanel</tt> component is extended to span between the container's 
            left and right margins in accordance with the recommended offset, 
            as shown in the following illustration.</p>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <table align="center">
    <tr> 
      <td><img src="../../../images/articles/quickstart-gui/02_add_panels_2.png"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Now that we've added a panel to contain our UI's Name information, we need 
    to repeat the process to add another directly below the first for the E-mail 
    information. Refering to the following illustrations, repeat the previous 
    two tasks, paying attention to the GUI Builder's suggested positioning. Notice 
    that the suggested vertical spacing between the two JPanels is much narrower 
    than that at the edges. Once you have added the second JPanel, resize it such 
    that it fills the form's remaining vertical space. 
  <table align="center">
    <tr> 
      <td><img src="../../../images/articles/quickstart-gui/02_add_panels_3.png"></td>
    </tr>
    <!--<tr>
                        <td><img src="../../../images/articles/quickstart-gui/02_add_panels_4.png"></td>
                    </tr>-->
                    <tr>
    <td><img src="../../../images/articles/quickstart-gui/02_add_panels_5.png"></td>
    </tr>
  </table></p>
  <p>
  <p>Because we want to visually distinguish the functions in the upper and lower 
    sections of our GUI, we need to add a border and title to each JPanel. First 
    we'll accomplish this using the Properties window and then we'll try it using 
    the pop-up menu.</p>
  <table width="91%">
    <tr> 
      <td>
        <p>To add title borders to the JPanels: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Select the top JPanel in the GUI Builder. </li>
          <li>In the Properties window, click the ellipsis button (...) next to 
            the Border property. </li>
          <li>In the JPanel Border editor that appears, select the TitledBorder 
            node in the Available Borders pane. </li>
          <li>In the Properties pane below, enter <tt>Name</tt> for the Title 
            property. </li>
          <li>Click the ellipsis (...) next to the Font property, select Bold 
            for the Font Style, and enter 12 for the Size. Click OK to exit the 
            dialogs.</li>
          <li>Select the bottom JPanel and repeat steps 2 through 5, but this 
            time right-click the JPanel and access the Properties window using 
            the pop-up menu. Enter <tt>E-mail</tt> for the Title property. 
            <p>Titled borders are added to both <tt>JPanel</tt> components. </p>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h3 class="tutorial">Adding Individual Components to the Form</h3>
  <p>Now we need to start adding the components that will present the actual contact 
    information in our contact list. In this task we'll add four JTextFields that 
    will display the contact information and the JLabels that will describe them. 
    While accomplishing this, notice the horizontal and vertical guidelines that 
    the GUI Builder displays, suggesting the preferred component spacing as defined 
    by your operating system's look and feel. This ensures that your GUI is automatically 
    rendered respecting the target operating system's look and feel at runtime.</p>
  <table width="91%">
    <tr> 
      <td>
        <p>To add a JLabel to the form: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>In the Palette window, select the JLabel component from the Swing 
            category. </li>
          <li>Move the cursor over the <tt>Name</tt> JPanel we added earlier. 
            When the guidelines appear indicating that the JLabel is positioned 
            in the top left corner of the JPanel with a small margin at the top 
            and left edges, click to place the label. </li>
          <p>The JLabel is added to the form and a corresponding node representing 
            the component is added to the Inspector window.</p>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Before going further, we need to edit the display text of the JLabel we just 
    added. Though you can edit component display text at any point, the easiest 
    way is to do this as you add them. </p>
  <table width="91%">
    <tr> 
      <td>
        <p>To edit the display text of a JLabel: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Double-click the JLabel to select its display text.</li>
          <li>Type <tt>First Name:</tt> and press Enter.</li>
          <p>The JLabel's new name is displayed and the component's width adjusts 
            as a result of the edit. </p>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Now we'll add a JTextField so we can get a glimpse of the GUI Builder's baseline 
    alignment feature. </p>
  <table width="91%">
    <tr> 
      <td>
        <p>To add a JTextField to the form: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>In the Palette window, select the JTextField component from the 
            Swing category. </li>
          <li>Move the cursor immediately to the right of the <tt>First Name:</tt> 
            JLabel we just added. When the horizontal guideline appears indicating 
            that the JTextField's baseline is aligned with that of the JLabel 
            and the spacing between the two components is suggested with a vertical 
            guideline, click to position the JTextField. </li>
          <p>The JTextField snaps into position in the form aligned with the JLabel's 
            baseline, as shown in the following illustration. Notice that the 
            JLabel shifted downward slightly in order to align with the taller 
            text field's baseline. As usual, a node representing the component 
            is added to the Inspector window. </p>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <table align="center">
    <tr> 
      <td>
        <p align="center"><img src="../../../images/articles/quickstart-gui/03_indy_add_1.png"></p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Before proceeding further, we need to add an additional JLabel and JTextField 
    immediately to the right of those we just added, as shown in the following 
    illustration. This time enter <tt>Last Name:</tt> as the JLabel's display 
    text and leave the JTextFields' placeholder text as it is for now.</p>

            JLabel we added earlier. When the guidelines appear indicating that 
            the new JLabel's left edge is aligned with that of the JLabel above 
            and a small margin exists between them, shift-click to place the first 
            JLabel. </li>
          <li>While still pressing the Shift key, click to place another JLabel 
            immediately to the right of the first. Make certain to release the

            release the Shift key prior to positioning the last JLabel, simply 
            press the Escape key.</li>
          <p>The JLabels are added to the form creating a second row, as shown

  <h3 class="tutorial">Inserting Components</h3>
  <p>Often it is necessary to add a component between components that are already 
    placed in a form. Whenever you add a component between two existing components, 
    the GUI Builder automatically shifts them to make room for the new component. 
    To demonstrate this, we'll insert a JTextField between the JLabels we added 
    previously, as shown in the following two illustrations. </p>
  <table width="91%">

            Swing category. </li>
          <li>Move the cursor over the <tt>Title:</tt> and <tt>Nickname:</tt> 
            JLabels on the second row such that the JTextField overlaps both and 
            is aligned to their baselines. If you encounter difficulty positioning 
            the new text field, you can snap it to the left guideline of the <tt>Nickname</tt> 
            JLabel as shown in the first image below.</li>
          <li>Click to place the JTextField between the <tt>Title:</tt> and <tt>Nickname:</tt> 
            JLabels.</li>
          <p>The JTextField snaps into position between the two JLabels. The rightmost

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
<!--was Aligning Components-->
<p>Alignment is one of the most fundamental aspects of creating professional-looking 
  GUIs. In the previous section we got a glimpse of the IDE's alignment features 
  while adding the JLabel and JTextField components to our ContactEditorUI form. 
  Next, we'll take a more in depth look at the GUI Builder's alignment features 
  as we work with the various other components we need for our application.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <h3 class="tutorial">Component Alignment</h3>
  <p>Every time you add a component to a form, the GUI Builder effectively aligns 
    them, as evidenced by the alignment guidelines that appear. It is sometimes 
    necessary, however, to specify different relationships between groups of components 
    as well. Earlier we added four JLabels that we need for our ContactEditor 
    GUI, but we didn't align them. Now we'll align the two columns of JLabels 
    so that their right edges line up. </p>
  <table width="91%">
    <tr> 
      <td>
        <p>To align components: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Select the <tt>First Name:</tt> and <tt>Title:</tt> JLabels on the 
            left side of the form.</li>
          <li>Click the Align Right in Column button (<img src="../../../images/articles/quickstart-gui/align_r.png">) 
            in the toolbar. Alternately, you can right-click either one and choose 
            Align &gt; Right in Column from the pop-up menu.</li>
          <li>Repeat this for the <tt>Last Name:</tt> and <tt>Nickname:</tt> JLabels 
            as well.</li>
          <p>The JLabels' positions shift such that the right edges of their display 
            text are aligned. The anchoring relationships are updated, indicating 
            that the components have been grouped. </p>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Before we're finished with the JTextFields we added earlier, we need to make 
    sure that the two JTextFields we inserted between the JLabels are set to resize 
    correctly. Unlike the two JTextFields that we stretched to the right edge 
    of our form, inserted components' resizeability behavior isn't automatically 
    set. </p>
  <table width="91%">
    <tr> 
      <td>
        <p>To set component resizeability behavior:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Control-click the two inserted JTextField components to select them 
            in the GUI Builder.</li>
          <li>With both JTextFields selected, right-click either one of them and 
            choose Auto Resizing &gt; Horizontal from the pop-up menu.</li>
          <p>The JTextFields are set to resize horizontally at runtime. The alignment 
            guidelines and anchoring indicators are updated, providing visual 
            feedback of the component relationships. </p>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <table width="91%">
    <tr> 
      <td>
        <p>To set components to be the same size:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Control-click all four of the JTextFields in the form to select 
            them.</li>
          <li>With the JTextFields selected, right-click any one of them and choose 
            Set Default Size from the pop-up menu.</li>
          <p>The JTextFields are all set to the same width and indicators are 
            added to the top edge of each, providing visual feedback of the component 
            relationships.</p>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Now we need to add another JLabel describing the JComboBox that will enable 
    users to select the format of the information our ContactEditor application 
    will display.</p>
  <table width="91%">
    <tr> 
      <td>
        <p>To align a JLabel to a component group: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>In the Palette window, select the JLabel component from the Swing 
            category. </li>
          <li>Move the cursor below the <tt>First Name</tt> and <tt>Title</tt> 
            JLabels on the left side of the JPanel. When the guideline appears 
            indicating that the new JLabel's right edge is aligned with the right 
            edges of the component group above (the two JLabels), click to position 
            the component. </li>
          <p>The JLabel snaps into a right-aligned position with the column of 
            JLabels above, as shown in the following illustration. The GUI Builder 
            updates the alignment status lines indicating the component's spacing 
            and anchoring relationships. </p>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <table align="center">
    <tr> 
      <td> 
        <p align="center"><img src="../../../images/articles/quickstart-gui/06_align_1.png"></p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>As in the previous examples, double-click the JLabel to select its display 
    text and then enter <tt>Display Format:</tt> for the display name. Notice 
    that when the JLabel snaps into position, the other components shift to accommodate 
    the longer display text. </p>

  <h3 class="tutorial">Baseline Alignment</h3>
  <p>Whenever you add or move components that include text (JLabels, JTextFields, 
    and so forth), the IDE suggests alignments which are based on the baselines 
    of the text in the components. When we inserted the JTextField earlier, for 
    example, its baseline was automatically aligned to the adjacent JLabels. </p>
  <p>Now we'll add the combo box that will enable users to select the format of 
    the information that our ContactEditor application will display. As we add 
    the JComboBox, we'll align its baseline to that of the JLabel's text. Notice 
    once again the baseline alignment guidelines that appear to assist us with 
    the positioning. </p>
  <table width="91%">
    <tr> 
      <td>
        <p>To align the baselines of components: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>In the Palette window, select the JComboBox component from the Swing 
            category. </li>
          <li>Move the cursor immediately to the right of the JLabel we just added. 
            When the horizontal guideline appears indicating that the JComboBox's 
            baseline is aligned with the baseline of the text in the JLabel and 
            the spacing between the two components is suggested with a vertical 
            guideline, click to position the combo box.</li>
          <p> The component snaps into a position aligned with the baseline of 
            the JLabel to its left, as shown in the following illustration. The 
            GUI Builder displays status lines indicating the component's spacing 
            and anchoring relationships. </p>

          <p>As shown in the following illustration, the JComboBox's right edge 
            snaps into alignment with the JPanel's recommended edge margin and

  <p>Editing component models is beyond the scope of this tutorial, so for the

  <!--<h3 class="tutorial">Adding an Image Viewer </h3>
            <p>Since our application displays a picture of the currently selected contact,
            we need to add a Jlabel that will display images of the people included
            in our contact list to our ContactEditor form. In this step we'll add the
            JLabel to the form using alignment guidelines to anchor the component to

<h2>Reviewing What We've Learned</h2>
<p>We've gotten off to a good start building our ContactEditor GUI, but let's 
  take a minute to recap what we've learned while we add a few more of the components 
  our interface requires. </p>
<p>Until now we've concentrated on adding components to our ContactEditor GUI 
  using the IDE's alignment guidelines to help us with positioning. It is important 
  to understand, however, that another integral part of component placement is 
  anchoring. Though we haven't discussed it yet, you've already taken advantage 
  of this feature without realizing it. As mentioned previously, whenever you 
  add a component to a form, the IDE suggests the target look and feel's preferred 
  positioning with guidelines. Once placed, new components are also anchored to 
  the nearest container edge or component to ensure that component relationships 
  are maintained at runtime. In this section, we'll concentrate on accomplishing 
  the tasks in a more streamlined fashion while pointing out the work the GUI 
  builder is doing behind the scenes. </p>
<blockquote> 
  <h3 class="tutorial">Adding, Aligning, and Anchoring</h3>
  <p>The GUI Builder enables you to layout your forms quickly and easily by streamlining 
    typical workflow gestures. Whenever you add a component to a form, the GUI 
    Builder automatically snaps them into the preferred positions and sets the 
    necessary chaining relationships so you can concentrate on designing your 
    forms rather than struggling with complicated implementation details. </p>

          <p>The JTextField snaps into position on the right of the <tt>E-mail

            node is also added to the Inspector window. </p>
          <li>Drag the resize handle of the JTextField toward the right of the 
            enclosing JPanel until the alignment guidelines appear suggesting 
            the offset between the JTextField and JPanel edges. </li>
          <p>The JTextField's right edge snaps to the alignment guideline indicating

  <p>Now we need to add the JList that will display our ContactEditor's entire

          <li>Move the cursor immediately below the <tt>E-mail Address</tt> JLabel

  <p>Since JLists are used to display long lists of data, they typically require 
    the addition of a JScrollPane. Whenever you add a component which requires 
    a JScrollPane, the GUI Builder automatically adds it for you. Because JScrollPanes

  <h3 class="tutorial">Component Sizing</h3>
  <p>It is often beneficial to set several related components, such as buttons 
    in modal dialogues, to be the same size for visual consistency. To demonstrate 
    this we'll add four JButtons to our ContactEditor form that will allow us 
    to add, edit, and remove individual entries from our contact list, as shown 
    in the following illustrations. Afterwards, we'll set the four buttons to 
    be the same size so they can be easily recognized as offering related functionality. 
  </p>
  <table width="91%">
    <tr> 
      <td>
        <p>To add, align, and edit the display text of multiple buttons: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>In the Palette window, select the JButton component.</li>
          <li>Move the JButton over the right edge of the <tt>E-mail Address</tt> 
            JTextField in the lower JPanel. When the guidelines appear indicating 
            that the JButton's baseline and right edge are aligned with that of 
            the JTextField, shift-click to place the first button along the JFrame's 
            right edge. The JTextField's width shrinks to accommodate the JButton 
            when you release the mouse button.</li>
          <li>Move the cursor over the top right corner of the JList in the lower 
            JPanel. When the guidelines appear indicating that the JButton's top 
            and right edges are aligned with that of the JList, shift-click to 
            place the second button along the JFrame's right edge.</li>
          <li>Add two additional JButtons below the two we already added to create 
            a column. Make certain to position the JButtons such that the suggested 
            spacing is respected and consistent. If you forget to release the 
            Shift key prior to positioning the last JButton, simply press the 
            Escape key.</li>
          <li>Double-click each JButton and enter the text for each of their names. 
            Enter <code>Add</code> for the top button, <code>Edit</code> for the 
            second, <code>Remove</code> for the third, and <code>As Default</code> 
            for the fourth. </li>
          <p>The JButton components snap into the positions designated by the 
            alignment guidelines. The width of the buttons changes to accommodate 
            the new names. </p>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>

  <p>Now that the buttons are positioned where we want them, we'll set the four

    they are related functionally.</p>
  <table width="91%">

            the pop-up menu. 
            <p>The JButtons are set to the same size as the button with the longest 
              name. </p>

  <h3 class="tutorial">Indentation</h3>
  <p>Often it is necessary to cluster multiple components under another component 
    such that it is clear they belong to a group of related functions. One typical 
    case, for example, is placing several related checkboxes below a common label. 
    The GUI Builder enables you to accomplish indenting easily by providing special 
    guidelines suggesting the preferred offset for your operating system's look 
    and feel.</p>
  <p>In this section we'll add a few JRadioButtons below a JLabel that will allow 
    users to customize the way the application displays data. Refer to the following 
    illustrations while accomplishing this or click the View Demo icon following 
    the procedure to view an interactive demonstration. </p>
  <table width="91%">
    <tr> 
      <td>
        <p>To indent JRadioButtons below a JLabel: </p>
        <ol>
          <li> Add a JLabel named <tt>Mail Format</tt> to the form below the JList. 
            Make certain the label is left aligned with the JList above.</li>
          <li>In the Palette window, select the JRadioButton component from the 
            Swing category. </li>
          <li>Move the cursor below the JLabel that we just added. When the guidelines 
            appear indicating that the JRadioButton's left edge is aligned with 
            that of the JLabel, move the JRadioButton slightly to the right until 
            secondary indentation guidelines appear. Shift-click to place the 
            first radio button. </li>
          <li>Move the cursor to the right of the first JRadioButton. Shift-click 
            to place the second and third JRadioButtons, being careful to respect 
            the suggested component spacing. Make certain to release the Shift 
            key prior to positioning the last JRadioButton. </li>
          <li>Double-click each JRadioButton and enter the desired text for each 
            of their names. Enter <code>HTML</code> for the left radio button, 
            <code>Plain Text </code> for the second, and <code>Custom</code> for 
            the third. </li>
          <p>Three JRadioButtons are added to the form and indented below the 
            <tt>Mail Format</tt> JLabel. </p>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <table align="center">

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Now we need to add the three JRadioButtons to a ButtonGroup to enable the 
    expected toggle behavior in which only one radio button can be selected at 
    a time. This will, in turn, ensure that our NameFinder application's contact 
    information will be displayed in the mail format of our choosing.</p>

    <tr> 
      <td>
        <p>To add JRadioButtons to a ButtonGroup:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>In the Palette window, select the ButtonGroup component from the 
            Swing category. </li>
          <li>Click anywhere in the GUI Builder design area to add the ButtonGroup 
            component to the form. Notice that the ButtonGroup does not appear 
            in the form itself, however, it is visible in the Inspector's Other 
            Component area. </li>
          <li>Select all three of the JRadioButtons in the form.</li>
          <li>In the Properties window, choose buttonGroup1 from the buttonGroup 
            property combo box.</li>

<h2>Making the Final Adjustments </h2>
<p>We've managed to rough out our ContactEditor application's GUI, but there are 
  still a few things remaining to do. In this section, we'll take a look at a 
  couple of other typical layout tasks that the GUI Builder streamlines. </p>
<blockquote> 
  <h3 class="tutorial">Finishing Up</h3>
  <p>Now we need to add the buttons that will enable users to confirm the information 
    they enter for an individual contact and add it to the contact list or cancel, 
    leaving the database unchanged. In this step, we'll add the two required buttons 
    and then edit them so that they appear the same size in our form even though 
    their display text are different lengths.</p>
  <table width="91%">
    <tr> 
      <td>
        <p>To add and edit the display text of buttons: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>If the lower JPanel is extended to the bottom edge of the JFrame 
            form, drag the bottom edge of the JFrame down. This gives you space 
            between the edge of the JFrame and the edge of the JPanel for your 
            OK and Cancel buttons.</li>
          <li>In the Palette window, select the <tt>JButton</tt> component from 
            the Swing category.</li>
          <li>Move the cursor over the form below the E-mail JPanel. When the 
            guidelines appear indicating that the JButton's right edge is aligned 
            with the lower right corner of the JFrame, click to place the button.</li>
          <li>Add another JButton to the left of the first, making certain to 
            place it using the suggested spacing along the JFrame's bottom edge.</li>
          <li>Double-click each JButton to select their display text. Enter <tt>OK</tt> 
            for the left button and <tt>Cancel</tt> for right one. Notice that 
            the width of the buttons changes to accommodate the new names.</li>
          <li>Set the two JButtons to be the same size by selecting both, right-clicking 
            either, and choosing Same Size &gt; Same Width from the pop-up menu. 
            <p>The <tt>JButton</tt> components appear in the form and their corresponding 
              nodes are displayed in the Inspector window. The <tt>JButton</tt> 
              components' code is also added to the form's source file which is 
              visible in the Editor's Source view. Each of the JButtons are set 
              to the same size as the button with the longest name. </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The last thing we need to do is delete the placeholder text in the various 
    components. Note that while removing placeholder text after roughing out a 
    form can be a helpful technique in avoiding problems with component alignments 
    and anchoring relationships, most developers typically remove this text in 
    the process of laying out their forms. As you go through the form, select 
    and delete the placeholder text for each of the JTextFields. We'll leave the 
    placeholder items in both the JComboBox and JList for a later tutorial.</p>

<a name="deploying"></a>
<h2>Deploying GUI Applications</h2>
    <p>In order for the interfaces you create with the GUI Builder to work outside 
        of the IDE, the application must be compiled against classes for the GroupLayout 
    layout manager and also have those classes available at runtime. These classes 
    are included in Java SE 6, but not in Java SE 5. If you develop the application 
    to run on Java SE 5, your application needs to use the Swing Layout Extensions library. 
    </p>
    <p>If you are running the IDE on JDK 5, the IDE automatically generates your application code 
        to use the Swing Layout Extensions library. When you deploy the application, you need to 
    include the Swing Layout Extensions library with the application. The IDE 
    automatically provides a copy of the library's JAR file in the application's <tt>dist/lib</tt> 
    folder.  The IDE also adds each of the JAR files that are in the <tt>dist/lib</tt> folder
        to the <tt>Class-Path</tt> element in the application JAR file's <tt>manifest.mf</tt> 
    file. </p>
    <p>If you are running the IDE on JDK 6, the IDE generates your application code 
        to use the GroupLayout classes that are in Java SE 6. This means that you can deploy the application 
        to run on systems with Java SE 6 installed and you do not need to package 
    your application with the Swing Layout Extensions library.</p>

    <div style="border: 1px solid rgb(14, 27, 85); padding: 10px 30px; background-color: rgb(231, 231, 231); margin-left: 60px; margin-right: 40px;"> 
  <b>Note:</b> If you create your application using JDK 6 but you need the application 
  to also run on Java SE 5, you can have the IDE generate its code to use the Swing Layout Extensions library 
  instead of the classes in Java SE 6. Open the ContactEditorUI class in the GUI Editor. 
  In the Inspector, expand the ContactEditorUI node and choose Form ContactEditorUI. 
  In the Properties window, change the value of the Layout Generation Style property to 
  Swing Layout Extensions Library.
</div>

  <h3 class="tutorial">Distributing and Running Standalone GUI Applications</h3>


  <p>To prepare your GUI application for distribution outside of the IDE:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Zip the project's <tt>dist</tt> folder into 
    a ZIP archive. (The <tt>dist</tt> folder might also contain a <tt>lib</tt> folder, 
    which you would also need to include.)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To run a standalone GUI application from the command line:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Navigate to the project's <tt>dist</tt> folder.</li>
    <li>Type the following: 
      <blockquote> <tt>java -jar &lt;jar_name&gt;.jar</tt> </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ol>

</blockquote>
  <p><b>Note:</b> If you encounter 
  the following error:</p>
  <blockquote><tt>Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/jdesktop/layout/GroupLayout$Group</tt></blockquote>
  <p>Ensure that the manifest.mf file references the currently installed version 
    of the Swing Layout Extensions Library. </p>
