    <p>For this tutorial you need to have the following software installed on your computer:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>NetBeans IDE 6.0.</li>
        <li>Java Standard Development Kit (JDK) version 5.0 or 6.0.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Introduction: Beans Binding in NetBeans IDE 6.0</h2> 
    
    <p>Until the release of the beans binding library, it was somewhat cumbersome 
        to connect UI components to databases or to keep values of component 
        properties in sync. For example, displaying data from a standard database 
        in a JTable required the manual creation of utility classes to handle the connection 
        between the database and the JTable. And keeping values 
        of different bean properties in sync (such as the value of a JTextField with 
        the rendering of a visual bean) required hand-coding of listeners and 
    event handlers.</p>
    <p>The beans binding library simplifies and standardizes all of this. You can merely write a 
        few lines of code to establish which properties of which components need to be 
        kept in sync, and the beans binding library handles the rest. In the NetBeans IDE, beans 
        binding features are integrated in the GUI Builder, so you can quickly get 
        the behavior of your application coded soon after you have established the visual 
    design.</p>
    <p>This guide is an overview of the main aspects of beans binding in the IDE. 
        For a concrete example of many of these features, you can try the 
        <a href="gui-db.html">Building a Java Desktop Database Application tutorial</a>.
        
        <a name="prop-binding"></a> 
        <h2>Binding Properties to Other Properties</h2> 
        <p>At its most basic, beans binding is a way to connect bean properties without 
        using event listening and handling code.</p>
        
        <p>To illustrate the concept of beans binding and how the IDE supports it, 
            we will do a simple example where a user can adjust a slider to 
        change a numerical value in a text field.</p>
        
        <p><b>To set up the example:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the IDE, choose, File &gt; New Project.</li>
            <li>Select the Java category and select the Java Application template. 
            Click Next.</li>
            <li>In the Name and Location page of the wizard, perform the following operations:
                <ul>
                    <li>Type <tt>NumberSlider</tt> as the project name.</li>
                    <li>Leave the Set As Main Project checkbox selected.</li>            
                    <li>Clear the Create Main Class checkbox.</li>
            </ul>
                        <p><img src="../../../images/articles/60/java/gui-binding/numberslider.png" 
                alt="Image showing the Name & Location page of the New Java Application wizard 
                with the project information filled in.">
            </p></li>
            <li>Click Finish to exit the wizard and set up the project.</li>
            <li>In the Projects window, right-click the NumberSlider project node 
                and choose New &gt; JFrame Form.
                <p>(If JFrame Form is not available in the New menu, choose Other. 
                    Then in the New File wizard, select the Swing GUI Forms category and 
                select the JFrame Form template.)</p>
</li>
            <li>In the Name and Location page of the wizard, perform the following operations:
                <ul>
                    <li>Type <tt>NumberSliderFrame</tt> for the class name.</li>
                    <li>Type <tt>numberslider</tt> for the package name.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><img src="../../../images/articles/60/java/gui-binding/numberslider2.png" 
                alt="Image showing the Name & Location page of the New JFrame wizard 
                with the file information filled in.">
            </p></li>
            <li>Click Finish to exit the wizard and create the form.
            <p><tt>NumberSliderForm.java</tt> should open in design mode in the editing area.</p></li>
            <li>From the Swing Controls section of the Palette, drag a 
            slider component into the design area. (If the Palette window is not open, 
            choose Window &gt; Palette.)</li>
            <li>From the Palette, drag a text field component to the design area.
                <p>The resulting form might look something like the screenshot below. However, 
                positioning is not important for purposes of this example.</p>
                <p><img src="../../../images/articles/60/java/gui-binding/slider-textfield.png" 
                alt="Image showing the form with both the slider and text field added to the form.">
            </p></li>
        </ol>
        <div class="indent">
        <h3>Source and Target</h3>
        <p>Now that we have set up the example, we are ready to create the 
            binding. However, first we need to determine which component will 
            be the <i>source</i> of the binding and which will be the <i>target</i>. 
        The binding source component is where a value for the property first originates.</p>
        <p>When binding in the GUI Editor, you initiate a binding on the target and 
        then you declare the source in the Bind dialog box.</p>
        <p>In this case, since the JSlider comes with a default range of values, 
        we will use it as the source.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> Bindings can be two-way (read/write), so that changes in 
            the target are automatically reflected in the source. However, 
            the direction of the initial binding is always from the source to the 
            target. See the information on 
            Update Mode in the <a href="gui-binding.html#prop-advanced">Advanced Binding Configuration</a> 
        section.</p>
    <p><b>To bind the slider to the text field:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Right-click the text field component and choose Bind &gt; text to 
        open the Bind dialog box.</li>
        <li>From the Binding Source combo box, select <tt>jSlider1</tt>.</li>
        <li>From the Binding Expression combo box, select <tt>value int</tt> 
            as shown in the image below.
            <p><img src="../../../images/articles/60/java/gui-binding/bind-dialog.png" 
            alt="Image showing values to select in the Binding Source combo box.">
        </p></li>
        <li>Click OK.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You have just bound the <tt>value</tt> bean property of the slider to 
    the <tt>text</tt> value of the text field.</p>
    <p>In the design area, the text field should show the value <tt>50</tt>. This value reflects the fact that the slider is in the middle 
    position and the default range of values for the slider is from 0 to 100.</p>
    <p>You can now run the application and see the binding in action.</p>
    
    <p><b>To run the project:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Choose Run &gt; Run Main Project.</li>
        <li>In the Run Project dialog box, click OK to accept 
        <tt>numberslider.NumberSliderForm</tt> as the main class.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The applications should start in a separate window. Adjust the slider 
    in the running application and watch the value change in the text field.</p>
    <p><img src="../../../images/articles/60/java/gui-binding/run-numberslider.png" 
    alt="Image showing the running application with the slider moved and the 
    text value changed.">
    </p>
    
    <!--TODO - note The syntax shown in the 
    Binding Expression field comes from expression language syntax, which is similar to what is used in JSP and JSF 
programming.-->
    </div>
    <a name="prop-advanced"></a> 
    <h2>Advanced Binding Configuration</h2> 
    <p>The example above shows a straightforward binding with some default behaviors. 
        But sometimes you might want or need to configure your binding differently. If 
    that is the case, you can use the Advanced tab of the Binding dialog box.</p>
    
    <p>The Advanced tab of the dialog box contains the following fields:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Name. </b>Enables you to create a name for the binding, 
            which gives you more flexibility for managing your bindings. The name is added to 
            the constructor of the binding and can be referenced with the binding's <tt>getName()</tt> 
        method.</li>
        <li><b>Update Mode. </b> Specifies the way that the properties are kept synchronized. 
            The possible values are: 
            <ul>
                <li><b>Always sync (read/write).</b> Whenever a change is made to either 
                the source or the target, the other is updated.</li>
                <li><b>Only read from source (read only).</b>  The target is only updated 
                    the first time the source value is set. Changes that are made to the 
                    source are updated in the target. Changes made to the target are not updated in 
                the source.</li>        
                <li><b>Read from source once (read once).</b>  The target is only updated 
                when the target and source are initially bound.</li>        
        </ul></li> 
        <li><b>Update Source When </b>(available only to the <tt>text</tt> property of JTextField and 
            JTextArea components). Enables you to select the frequency with which 
            the properties are synchronized.
        </li>     
        <li><b>Ignore Adjusting</b> (available to the <tt>value</tt> property of JSlider; 
            to the <tt>selectedElement</tt> property of JTable and JList; 
            and to the <tt>selectedElements</tt> property of JTable and JList). 
            If this checkbox is selected, any changes made to one 
            property are not propagated to the other property until the user is finished making the 
            change. For example, when the application's user drags a slider, the value 
            of the property to which the slider's <tt>value</tt> property is bound is only 
            updated once the user releases the mouse button.
        </li> 
        <li><b>Converter.</b> If your binding involves properties with different data 
            types, you can specify code that converts values between the types. 
            The beans binding library handles many commonly needed conversions, but you might 
            need to provide your own converters for other combinations of property types. 
            Such converters need to extend the <tt>org.jdesktop.beansbinding.Converter</tt> 
            class.
            <p>The Converter drop-down list is populated with any converters that have 
                been added as beans  
                to your form. You can also add the conversion code directly by 
                clicking the ellipsis (...) button, and selecting Custom Code from the 
            Select Converter Property Using drop-down list.</p>
        </li>    
        <li><b>Validator. </b> Enables you to specify code to validate a change in the target 
            property value before propagating that change back to the source property. 
            For example, you can use a validator to make sure that an integer property value 
            is within a specific range.
            <p>Validators need to extend the 
            <tt>org.jdesktop.beansbinding.Validator</tt> class.
            <p>The Validator drop-down list is populated with any validators that have 
                been added as beans
                to your form. You can also add the validation code directly by 
                clicking the ellipsis (...) button, and selecting Custom Code from the 
        Select Validator Property Using drop-down list.</p></li>
        <li><b>Null Source Value. </b> Enables you to specify a different value to use if 
            the source property has a <tt>null</tt> value when the binding is attempted. 
            This field corresponds with the <tt>setSourceNullValue()</tt> method 
        of the <tt>org.jdesktop.beansbinding.Binding</tt> class.</li>     
        <li><b>Unreadable Source Value. </b> Enables you to specify a different value to use if 
            the binding expression cannot be resolved when the binding is attempted. 
            This field corresponds with the <tt>setSourceUnreadableValue()</tt> method 
        of the <tt>org.jdesktop.beansbinding.Binding</tt> class.</li>    
    </ul>
    <p><b>Note:</b> To better understand the classes and methods mentioned above, you can 
            access the beans binding Javadoc documentation directly 
            from the IDE. Choose Help &gt; Javadoc References &gt; Beans Binding. In the browser 
            window that opens, click the <tt>org.jdesktop.beansbinding</tt> link to access 
        documentation for those classes.</p>
    
    <a name="data-binding"></a> 
    <h2>Binding Data to Components</h2> 
    
    <p>Once you have created a new Java form and added components to the form, 
        you can generate code to bind those components to data. The IDE makes 
    it easy to bind data to Swing JTable, JList, and JComboBox components.</p>
    <p>Before binding a component to data from a database, you need to have done the following things:</p>        
    <ul>
        <li>Connected to a database in the IDE.
        <li>Added the component to a form in the GUI Builder.</li>
        <li>Created classes that represent the database tables to which you want to 
            bind. Steps on creating the entity classes for binding data to a component  
        are given below.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="indent">
    <h3>Creating Entity Classes</h3>
    <!--TODO verbiage on creating of entity classes; stuff about foreign keys-->
    <p><b>To create entity classes to represent the database that is to be bound to the JTable:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In the Projects window, right-click your project and choose 
            New &gt; Other, select the Persistence category, and select the 
        Entity Classes from Database template. </li>
        <li>In the Database Tables page of the wizard, select the 
        database connection.</li>
        <li>Once the Available Tables column is populated, select the tables 
            that you want to use in your application and click Add to move them to 
            the Selected Tables column. Click Next.

        <li>Click Create Persistence Unit.</li>
        <li>In the Create Persistence Unit dialog box, make sure of the following things:
            <ul>
                <li>That the selected Persistence Library is TopLink.</li>
                <li>That the selected Table Generation Strategy is "None".</li>

            </ul> 
        </li>
        <li>Click Finish.
        <p>You should see nodes for the entity classes in the Projects window.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Binding Components to the Beans That Represent the Data</h3>
    <p><b>To bind the data to a JTable component:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Right-click the component in the GUI Builder and choose Bind &gt; elements.</li>
        <li>Click Import Data to Form. From the Import Data to Form dialog box, 
            select the database table to which you want to bind your components. 
        Click OK.</li>
        <li>From the Binding Source combo box, select the item that represents the 
            result list of the entity class. For example, if the entity class is called, 
        <tt>Customer.java</tt>, the list object would be generated as <tt>customerList</tt>.</li>
        <li>Leave the Binding Expression value as <tt>null</tt>.
        <li>If there are any database columns that you want to appear in the JTable, 
        select those columns in the Selected list and move them to the Available list.</li>
        <li>Select the Advanced tab
            to further configure the binding. For example, 
            you can specify a validator or converter, or you can specify behavior 
        if the binding source is null or unreadable.</li>
        <li>Click OK.</li>
    </ol>      
    <p><b>To bind the data to a JList component:</b></p>
    <ol>

            quickly create a whole working application that has CRUD (create, read, 
            update, and delete) features. However, it is better to generate all 
            the entity classes in advance to ensure that all relations among 
            the entities are correctly covered by the generated classes.

    <h2>Special Binding Properties</h2> 

    <p>Where necessary, the beans binding library provides special synthetic 
        properties for some Swing components that are missing from the components 
        themselves. These properties represent things, such as a table's selected row, 
    that are useful to bind to other properties.</p>    

    <p>Below is a list of the synthetic properties added by the beans binding libraries:</p>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" summary="The left column lists the
   component. The middle column lists properties available for the 
   component in the left column. The right column provides a description of the property.">
        <tr align="left" valign="top">
            <th scope="col">Component</th>
            <th scope="col">Property</th>
