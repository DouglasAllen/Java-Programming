<h1>NetBeans 6.0 CLDC/MIDP Development Quick Start Guide</h1>


<p>This document takes you through the basics of using NetBeans IDE 6.0 to create 
  a Java&#8482; Platform, Micro Edition (Java&#8482; ME platform), Mobile Information 
  Device Profile (MIDP) application. This document is designed to get you going 
  as quickly as possible. 
<!--More information about using the Java ME support in 
  the NetBeans development environment is provided in the following document:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="import-mobility.html">Importing Existing Java ME MIDP/CLDC Source
    Code into the NetBeans IDE </a></li>
</ul>
--->
<p>The following tutorial takes you through some of the basic steps of working with the new project system.
 We show you two ways to create a Java ME MIDP project named "MyHello" that displays the text "Hello World" 
 in a device emulator. We also take a quick look at other Mobility features for CLDC/MIDP development.</p>

<h2><a name="reqs"> Requirements</h2>
<p>You must have the NetBeans IDE 6.0 Mobility or Full edition  
  installed before you can start Java ME MIDP/CLDC development. The Client/Server 
  sections require the Full Edition for Web Services support. If you installed 
  only the Mobility Edition, you need to download the following plugins from the 
  Update center (Tools &gt; Plugins):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Web Applications</li>
  <li>Web Services</li>
  <li>Sun Java System Application Server

</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="vmd"></a>Creating a MIDP Application Using the Visual Mobile Designer</h2>
  <p>The NetBeans IDE provides a wizard that enables you to quickly create a MIDP
    project. When creating the project, you can choose to develop your application
    in the Visual Mobile Designer (VMD) or in the Source Code Editor.</p>
<p>Using the Visual Mobile Designer gives you the ability to graphically plan
  out the flow of the application and design the screens the application
  uses. The designer automatically creates the code for the application. </p>
  <div class="indent">
  <h3 class="tutorial">Creating a MIDP/CLDC Application </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Choose File &gt; New Project (Ctrl+Shift+N). Under Categories, select 
      Mobility. Under Projects, select MIDP Application and click Next.</li>
    <li>Enter <code>MyHello</code> in the Project Name field. Change the Project 
      Location to any directory on your system. In this tutorial we refer to 
      this directory as <code>$PROJECTHOME</code>. </li>
    <li>Check the Set as Main Project and Create Hello MIDlet check boxes (both 
      are checked by default). Click Next. </li>
    <li>Leave the J2ME Wireless Toolkit as the selected Target Platform. Click 
      Next. </li>
    <li><a name="template"></a>Expand &quot;Configuration templates provided by 
      installed CLDC platforms&quot; and &quot;J2ME Wireless Toolkit 2.2&quot; 
      folders. Check the boxes next to each of the configurations. <br>
      The IDE automatically creates a new project configuration for each template 
      listed. <br>
      <br>
      <img src="../../../images/mobility/60/cldcqs/newprojectdialog.png"> </li>
    <li>Click Finish. The IDE creates the <code>$PROJECTHOME/MyHello</code> project 
      folder. The project folder contains all of your sources and project metadata, 
      such as the project Ant script.
      The application itself is displayed in the Flow Design window of the Visual 
      Mobile Designer.</li>
    <p><img src="../../../images/mobility/60/cldcqs/newmobileproject.png" width="600" height="322">&nbsp;</p>
  </ol>
  <h3 class="tutorial">Editing the Java Source Code</strong></h3>
  <p>Now let's edit the text displayed by the MIDlet.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Click on Screen.
      This opens the Screen Designer window, and displays the Device
      screen, which is the only screen available in the application. </li>
    <li>In the Properties window, click in the Text field and type in some new 
      text. </li>
  </ol>
  <h3 class="tutorial"><strong>Compiling and Running the Project</strong></h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Choose Run &gt; Run Main Project (F6) from the Run menu. Follow the progress 
      of the project compilation in the Output window. Note that the <code>HelloMIDlet.java 
      </code>file is built before it is executed. A device emulator opens to display 
      the results of the executed MIDlet. The default device emulator is <code>DefaultColorPhone</code>.</li>
    <li>In the device emulator window, click on the button below the Launch command. 
      The device emulator launches the MIDlet and displays the text you entered 
      in the source code. <br>
      <br>
      <img src="../../../images/mobility/60/cldcqs/60midpqs-emulator.png" width="366" height="729"> 
    </li>
    <li>Click on the button below Exit to close the MIDlet. Then click on the 
      button in the upper right corner of the device to close the emulator window. 
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<h2><a name="source"></a>Creating a MIDP Application Using the Source Editor</h2>
<p>Using the Source Code Editor, you manually create the code for your MIDlets.
  Creating code in the Source Code Editor gives you more flexibility when editing
  the code, and enables you to insert preprocessor code blocks.</p>
<p>Now we'll create the same application using the New Project and New File wizards, 
  and complete the code using the Source Editor. </p>
<div class="indent">
  <h3 class="tutorial"><strong>Creating a New Java ME MIDP project </strong></h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Choose File &gt; New Project (Ctrl-Shift-N). Under Categories, select 
      Mobility. Under Projects, select MIDP Application and click Next.</li>
    <li>Enter <code>MyHelloMIDlet</code> in the Project Name field (note that 
      &quot;MID&quot; is in upper case letters). Change the Project Location to 
      any directory on your system. We refer to this directory 
      as <code>$PROJECTHOME</code> in this tutorial. </li>
    <li>Check the Set as Main Project checkbox and remove the check from the Create 
      Hello MIDlet checkbox. Click Next. </li>
    <li>Leave the J2ME Wireless Toolkit as the selected Target Platform. </li>
    <li>Expand &quot;Configuration templates provided by installed CLDC platforms&quot; 
      and &quot;J2ME Wireless Toolkit 2.2&quot; folders. Check the boxes next 
      to each of the configurations. <br>
      The IDE automatically creates a new project configuration for each 
      template listed. </li>
    <li>Click Finish. The IDE creates the <code>$PROJECTHOME/MyHelloMIDlet</code> 
      project folder. The project folder contains all of your sources and project 
      metadata, such as the project Ant script. </li>
    <li>Right-click the <code>MyHelloMIDlet</code> node in the Explorer window 
      and choose New &gt; MIDlet</li>
    <li>Enter <code>HelloMIDlet</code> as the MIDlet name (note that &quot;MID&quot; 
      is in upper case letters). Click Finish. The <code>HelloMIDlet.java</code> 
      file is created.</li>
    <li>Double click the <code>HelloMIDlet.java</code> file to display the source 
      code in the Editor. </li>
    <li>Click in the Source Editor and change 
      <pre class="examplecode">public class HelloMIDlet extends MIDlet</pre>
      
      to 
      <pre class="examplecode">public class HelloMIDlet
              extends MIDlet implements javax.microedition.lcdui.CommandListener
              {</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Add the following text before the <code>startApp()</code> method: 
      <pre class="examplecode">public HelloMIDlet() {
}private void initialize() {  javax.microedition.lcdui.Display.getDisplay(this).setCurrent(get_helloTextBox());}
public void commandAction(javax.microedition.lcdui.Command command, javax.microedition.lcdui.Displayable
  displayable) {   if (displayable == helloTextBox) {      if (command == exitCommand) {         javax.microedition.lcdui.Display.getDisplay(this).setCurrent(null);         destroyApp(true);         notifyDestroyed();      }   }
}
private javax.microedition.lcdui.TextBox get_helloTextBox() {   if (helloTextBox == null) {       helloTextBox = new javax.microedition.lcdui.TextBox(null, "Test String",120, 0x0);       helloTextBox.addCommand(get_exitCommand());       helloTextBox.setCommandListener(this);   }   return helloTextBox;}
private javax.microedition.lcdui.Command get_exitCommand() {   if (exitCommand == null) {       exitCommand = new javax.microedition.lcdui.Command("Exit", javax.microedition.lcdui.Command.EXIT,
  1);   }   return exitCommand;}
javax.microedition.lcdui.TextBox helloTextBox;javax.microedition.lcdui.Command exitCommand;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Add a line <code>initialize();</code> to the <code>startApp()</code> method, 
      so it looks like the following: 
      <pre class="examplecode">  public void startApp() {
   initialize();
    }</pre>
  </ol>
      <h3 class="tutorial">Editing the Java Source Code</strong></h3>

      <p>Now let's add some text for our MIDlet to display.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>In the <code>get_helloTextBox()</code> method, replace the "test string"
      code with the text of your choice. For example, "Hello World."</ol>

  <h3 class="tutorial">Compiling and Running the Project</strong></h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Choose Run &gt; Run Main Project (F6) from the Run menu. Follow the progress 
      of the project compilation in the Output window. Note that the <code>HelloMIDlet.java 
      </code>file is built before it is executed. A device emulator opens to display 
      the results of the executed MIDlet. The default device emulator is <code>DefaultColorPhone</code>.</li>
    <li>In the device emulator window, click on the button below the Launch command. 
      The device emulator launches the MIDlet and displays the text you entered 
      in the source code. </li>
    <li>Click on the button below Exit to close the MIDlet. Then click on the 
      button in the upper right corner of the device to close the emulator window. 
    </li>
  </ol>

</div>
<h2><a name="emulators"></a> Changing the Emulator Platform</h2>
<p>Emulator platforms are provided by mobile phone manufacturers so developers
  can simulate the behavior of specific mobile devices while coding, debugging,
  and testing applications. The NetBeans Mobility Pack includes the J2ME Wireless
  Toolkit, and supports many other software development kits (SDKs) that you can
  download from provider sites, such as Nokia, Sony Ericsson, or Motorola. </p>
<div class="indent">
  <h3 class="tutorial">Changing the Default Emulator Device</strong></h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Right-click the MyHello Project node and choose Properties. In the Properties 
      dialog, choose the Platform node. Here, you can change the device for the 
      default configuration.</li>
    <li>Click the Device drop-down list and choose QwertyDevice. Click OK.</li>
    <li>Run the application again, and the application runs in the <code>QwertyDevice</code> 
      emulator. </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Changing the Project Configuration</h3>
  <p>You created several project configurations using the <a href="quickstart.html#template">templates</a> 
    in the New Project wizard. You can use the drop-down Configuration menu in 
    the main toolbar to quickly change project configurations.</p>
  <h3 class="tutorial">Adding a New Emulator Platform</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Choose Tools &gt; Java Platforms from the main toolbar.</li>
    <li>In the Java Platform Manager dialog, click the Add Platform button. </li>
    <li>In the Select Platform Type page, choose the Java ME MIDP Edition Platform 
      Emulator. Click Next. 
      In the Platforms page, the IDE searches for all available Java ME platforms
      and lists them in the window. Platforms that are compliant with the Unified
      Emulator Interface (UEI) standard are verified and appear with a check in
      the checkbox next to the platform name. Platforms that are not UEI-compliant,
      or that you might not be able to install for other reasons, are listed in
      red. The wizard also identifies which platforms have already been installed.
      
      <strong>NOTE:</strong> To install platforms that are not UEI-compliant,
      click the Back button and choose Custom Java Micro Edition Platform Emulator.
    </li>
    <li>In the Platforms page, put a check next to any platform emulator you want 
      to install. After the platforms are detected, they are installed. Click 
      Finish. Then click Close. </li>
    <li>Choose File &gt; "MyHello" Properties.</li>
    <li>Choose the Platform node, then choose the name of the new emulator (for
      example, J2ME Wireless Toolkit 2.2) from the Emulator Platform drop-down
      menu. Click OK.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
<h2><a name="configs"></a>Using Configurations</h2>
<p>You can use configurations to create more than one set of distribution JAR
  and Java Application Descriptor (JAD) files for your project. This enables you
  to create one set of source code and customize it for each mobile device you're
  programming for.</p>
<div class="indent"> 
  <h3 class="tutorial"><strong>Adding a Configuration</strong></h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Right-click the MyHello Project node and choose Properties. In the Properties 
      dialog, Choose Add Configuration from the Project Configuration drop-down 
      list. This opens the Add Configuration dialog.</li>
    <li>Enter a name for your configuration in the Configuration Name field. The 
      name should identify the target platform you deploy the JAR/JAD 
      created for this configuration. For this example, enter <code>BlackWhiteDisplay</code> 
      and click OK. You have just created a new configuration.</li>
    <li>Configurations can also be added by clicking the Manage Configurations 
      button in the Properties dialog. This brings up the Project Configuration 
      Manager dialog which contains options for adding, removing, or duplicating 
      configurations.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 class="tutorial"><strong>Customizing a Configuration</strong></h3>
  <p>You can add as many configurations as you would like to your project. You 
    can then modify settings in the Project Properties dialog for each configuration 
    that you've added.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Right-click the MyHello Project node and choose Properties. In the Properties 
      dialog, choose the Platform node. </li>
    <li>Choose the <code>BlackWhiteDisplay</code> configuration from the configuration 
      combo box at the top of the Properties dialog. </li>
    <li>The components in the Platform dialog are all disabled. This is because 
      this configuration is currently taking the values used by the default configuration 
      for this panel. Uncheck the Use Values from &quot;DefaultConfiguration&quot; 
      option at the top of the panel. All components on this panel can now be 
      edited. </li>
    <li>Change the Device option to DefaultGrayPhone.</li>
    <li>Toggle the Project Configuration dialog at the top of the Properties dialog 
      and observe that the Device option changes based on which configuration 
      is currently selected. This method of configuration customization works 
      for each panel (other than the general panel) in the dialog. Click OK to 
      save your configuration changes and exit the Properties dialog.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 class="tutorial"><strong>Creating an Ability</strong></h3>
  <p>An <em>Ability</em> is a specific attribute of a project configuration. It 
    can be a physical attribute such as screen size, or an API or JSR supported 
    by the configuration. You can create a new ability and associate it with one 
    or more project configurations. You can then use preprocessior code blocks 
    to associate certain code with that ability. If you later need to add or remove 
    configurations, you do not have to go through all your code and associate the 
    configuration with each code block. Instead, you need only to add that ability 
    to the configuration. The configuration is then automatically associated with 
    any code block associated with that ability.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Right-click on the MyHello project node and choose Properties.</li>
    <li>Choose the Abilities page from the Category menu tree.</li>
    <li>Choose a configuration from the Project Configuration dropdown menu. This 
      associates  the ability with that  configuration.</li>
    <li>If necessary, uncheck the Use Values from "DefaultConfiguration" checkbox.</li>
    <li>Click the Add button. 
      This opens the Add Ability dialog.</li>
    <li>In the New Ability dialog, enter a name for the ability, or choose an 
      ability from the drop-down menu. Optionally, enter a value for the ability.
      Click Ok to close the New Ability dialog. The ability is now associated 
      with the selected project configuration.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>You can associate the ability with other configurations by choosing a different 
    configuration from the Project Configuration menu and clicking the Add button.</p>
  <h3 class="tutorial"><strong>Adding Configuration-Specific, Preprocessor 
    code</strong></h3>
  <p>Preprocessor blocks enable you to create, manage and track code that is specific 
    to one or more project configurations or abilities. The code is enabled (or 
    disabled) only for the configurations or abilities you identify.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>In the HelloMIDlet.java Editor window, right-click on the source code 
      line where TextBox is instantiated ( <code>helloTextBox = new javax.microedition.lcdui.TextBox(null, 
      &quot;Hello, World&quot;,120, 0x0);</code>). </li>
    <li>Right-click on the line and choose Preprocessor Blocks &gt; Create If/Else 
      Block. In the first, pink section, append the word "Color" to the "Hello 
      World" string. In the second, gray section, add "Gray" to the "Hello World" 
      string. </li>
    <li>The code marked by the <code>//#if</code> preprocessor directive is in effect whenever the active configuration matches the directive value 
      (in this case, DefaultConfiguration.) The code encased by the <code>//#else</code> 
      preprocessor directive is used whenever the active configuration does 
      <strong>not</strong> match the value of the preprocessor.
      
      In other words, the emulator displays &quot;Hello World Color&quot; whenever 
      the active platform is &quot;DefaultConfiguration,&quot; and displays &quot;Hello 
      World Gray&quot; if the active platform is any other emulator platform. 
      The //#endif preprocessor directive completes the preprocessor block. </li>
    <p>You can test the preprocessor code by running the MIDlet using different 
      emulator devices, as described in <a href="quickstart.html#changeemulator">Changing the 
      Emulator Platform</a>.</p>
  </ol>
  <h3 class="tutorial">Running Configurations</h3>
  <p>Configurations can be built and run individually or simultaneously.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Right-click the MyHelloMIDlet Project node and choose Run. </li>
    <li>Use the configuration combo box in the Toolbar to change the configuration 
      to BlackWhiteDisplay. Choose Run again. </li>
    <li>Two emulators appear, one color and one gray. The gray emulator displays 
      "Hello World Gray" and the color emulator displays "Hello World Color."</li>
  </ol>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div class="indent">To build multiple configurations simultaneously, right-click 
      on a project and choose Batch Build. In the dialog that opens, check the 
      box next to each configuration you want to build. </div>
  </li>
  <li> <div class="indent">To test a device on the fly, right-click on the project and choose Run 
    With. In the dialog that opens, choose the emulator platform and device you 
    want to run. </div></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="websvcs"></a>Connencting Mobile  Applications to Web Services </h2>
<p>The IDE enables you to create client MIDlets that can connect to Web services
  either through a direct &quot;two-tier&quot; architecture, or a &quot;three-tier&quot;
  architecture that connects to Web services through a middleware Web application.
</p>
<p>The IDE provides two wizards for creating the connecting classes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Use the The Java ME Web Service Client wizard if you want to use the JSR-172 
    Web Services specification to create a &quot;two-tier&quot; connection to 
    Web services. This wizard creates stub (client-side proxy) files and, optionally, 
    a sample client MIDlet that calls a web service. You must have a device or 
    emulator platform that supports the JSR-172 specification to use this wizard.
  </li>
  <li>Use the The Mobile Client to Web Application Generator to create a &quot;three-tier&quot; 
    connection to Web services if your devices do not support the JSR-172 Web 
    Services specification. The wizard generates a servlet that connects to a 
    web application that includes a web service client. Before you use the Mobile 
    Client to Web Application Generator, you must have a Web project that includes 
    a Web service client.</li>
</ul>

  <h3 class="tutorial"><strong>Creating a Java ME Web Services
    (JSR-172) Client</strong></h3>
<ol>
    
  <li>Right-click on a project node and choose New &gt; File.
  </li>
    
  <li>In the New File wizard, choose MIDP under Categories. Under File Types, 
    choose Java ME Web Service Client. Click Next. 
  </li>
    <li>Identify the WSDL file location for the Web service to be added to the 
      project. </li>
  <ul>
    If the WSDL service is on the Web: 
      <ol>
        <li>Choose Running Web Service and enter a URL for the WSDL file and 
          enter a local filename for the retrieved WSDL.</li>
        <li>If you are behind a firewall, click Proxy Settings to designate 
          the appropriate HTTP host and port.</li>
        <li>Click Retrieve WSDL to get a local copy of the WDSL file. The IDE 
          downloads the WSDL file.</li>
    </ol>
 </ul>
	<ul>
	If you have a WSDL file in your environment:
	<ol>
	 <li>Select the WSDL file from your system and enter a filename.</li>
     <li>The IDE retrieves the WSDL file and the rest of the fields on the page are filled 
		  with default names taken from the WSDL file name. </li>
	</ol>
  </ul>
	<li>Press Finish. 
    The IDE creates an opened settings file and generates client stubs. In the 
    Main Window, you can see a list of the Exported Services, Client Information, 
  and Client Options you can choose.</li>
</ol>
  <ul>
    <li>In some rare situations, you might need to convert CLDC 1.1 types to CLDC 
      1.0 types, which means Float and Double types are converted to String variables. 
      To make the conversion, select the checkbox &#8220;Convert floating point 
      to String&#8221; on the settings file and click the Generate Stubs button.
    </li>
  <li>If you are behind a firewall, there is no public setting available for the 
    HTTPS proxy within NetBeans. You can change the NetBeans proxy settings by 
    choosing Tools&gt;Options from the main menu. These settings do not, however, 
    propagate to emulators. You can set the proxy for the Wireless Toolkit by 
    choosing Tools &gt; Java Platforms. Under Platforms, choose the Wireelss Toolkit, 
    and then select the Tools &amp; Extensions tab. Click the Open Preferences 
    button and then select the Network Configuration tab. Changing the proxy for 
    other emulators is similar, but may differ from vendor to vendor.</li>
    <li> The generated files should not be edited. Any changes made to the files 
      are lost when you regenerate them.</li>
  </ul> 
<!---    <h3 class="tutorial"><strong>Using the Mobile Client to Web Application Generator</strong></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the Mobile Client to Web Application Generator by selecting a Mobile 
        Project from the Projects view and choosing File &gt; New File. In Categories, 
        chose MIDP. In File Types, choose Mobile Client to Web Application. Click 
        Next.</li>
      <li>In the Servlet and Client Type Selection page, select a web project, 
        servlet name, and package for the generated server code.</li>
      <li>In the same page, choose the type of web application the MIDlet interacts 
        with: 
        <ul>
          <li>If the mobile client connects directly to a Web application that 
            does not use a Web service, choose Methods in Web Application. </li>
          <li>If the mobile client connects to a Web service through a middleware 
            Web application, choose Web Services in Web Application, then use 
            the drop-down menu to choose the Web Service client. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>In the Service Selection page, identify the services to be exported 
        from the server to the client application.</li>
      <li>In the Client Options page, select a name and package for the generated 
        client class.</li>
      <li>In the same page, you can also determine the types of code to be generated:</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>Stub methods for each exported service</li>
      <li>Code enabling multiple calls per session</li>
      <li>Code that allows floating point values</li>
      <li>Tracing code</li>
      <li>A sample MIDlet you can examine and modify</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The template creates:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a Java ME client class</li>
      <li>a servlet and supporting classes</li>
      <li>a mapping file in xml format.</li>
      <li>if you choose, a MIDlet you can examine and modify. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Java ME client , mapping file and the MIDlet are generated under the 
      Java ME project. The servlet and supporting classes are generated under 
      the web project. The servlet is also added to the web application (<code>web.xml</code>).</li> </ol>

 <h2><a name="games"></a>Creating a Game Using the Game Designer</h2>
 <p class="tutorial">The Visual Mobile Designer now supports the MIDP 2.0 Gaming 
    API. In the VMD, you can arrange tiled layers into scenes and populate the 
    game with animated sprites.</p>
  <p class="tutorial">Before you begin, save all the images you want to use for 
    scenery and sprites into the src directory of your project. Then continue 
    as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <div class="tutorial">Create a new MIDP project with the &quot;Create Hello 
      MIDlet&quot; option unchecked. Then right-click the project and choose New 
      &gt; File. Under categories, choose MIDP. Under File Types, choose Visual 
      Game Design. Click Next. </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class="tutorial">Give the new class a name and click Finish. </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class="tutorial">The Game Builder Design Component screen opens. </div>
  </li>
  <li>Click on Create Scene. <br>
    A &quot;Scene&quot; is a level of a game. In the Game Designer Window, an 
    empty scene opens. </li>
  <li>To create a tiled layer (scenario environment), click the Create Tiled Layer 
    button in the upper right corner of the window.<br>
    Note that you can use sample images packaged with the IDE. To get the sample 
    images, click the Import sample images button. </li>
  <li>In the dialog that pops up, enter a name for your layer adjust the size 
    of your tiles to match the device you're programming for. Then Click OK. <br>
    After you create a new tiled layer, drag and drop tiles on the grid to create 
    a level for your game. <br>
    <br>
    <img src="../../../images/mobility/60midpqs-layer.png" width="525" height="726"> 
  </li>
  <li>You can create sprites for your game by choosing Sprites from the drop-down 
    menu, then dragging an image from the images window at the bottom of the IDE. 
    <br>
    You can use the Game Builder to animate your sprites and tiled layers. Game 
    Builder treats sprites as animated sequences, and you can edit and animate 
    multiple sprites simultaneously. <br>
