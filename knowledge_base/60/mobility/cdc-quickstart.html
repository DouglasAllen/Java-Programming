<h1>NetBeans Mobility 6.0  CDC Development Quick Start Guide</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> CDC application are designed to run on mobile and embedded devices with  at least 2MB of memory. This configuration supports 
  a more feature-rich JVM than MIDP-based mobile phones, which typically have 128 to 512KB 
  of memory and use the Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC). </p>
<p>This document takes you through the basics of using NetBeans IDE to create 
  a Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME platform), Connected Device Configuration 
  (CDC) application. We show you four different ways to create a Java ME CDC project 
  that displays a simple form in a device emulator, one  for each available profile. We also show an additional  way using the NSICom CrEme VM for Windows CE. This document is 
  designed to get you creating applications as quickly as possible. </p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>You must have the NetBeans 6.0 Mobility or Full edition (<a href="http://download.netbeans.org/netbeans/6.0/rc1/">download</a>) 
  installed before you can start Java ME CDC development. The Client/Server sections 
  require the Full Edition for Web Services support. If you installed only the 
  Mobility Edition, you need to download the following plugins from the Update 
  center (Tools &gt; Plugins):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Web Applications</li>
  <li>Web Services</li>
  <li>Sun Java System Application Server</li>
<li>Sun Java Toolkit for CDC or other CDC emulator platform installed. See Adding Emulator 
  Platforms, below for more information. </li>
</ul>
<h2> Adding Emulator Platforms<a name="platforms"></a></h2>
<p>The NetBeans Mobility Pack supports the following emulator platforms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sun Java Toolkit for CDC 1.0</li>
  <li>Ricoh Embedded Software Architecture Emulator 1.14c</li>
  <li>UIQ SDK 3</li>
  <li>Sony Ericsson M600 and P990 devices</li>
  <li>Nokia Series 80 Platform SDK for Symbian OS, for Java, Personal Profile</li>
</ul>
<p>Instructions for adding emulator platforms are listed in the <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/community/releases/55/1/mobilitycdc-install.html" target="_blank">NetBeans 
  Mobility Pack for CDC 5.5.1 Installation Guide</a> and  work for the 6.0 IDE as well.</p>
<h2>Creating a CDC Application<a name="creating"></a></h2>
<p>In this section we create a CDC application project for each available 
  profile and, for the Personal and AGUI platforms, create a GUI for the application 
  using the IDE's GUI Builder. </p>
<p>The Profiles described are: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="cdc-quickstart.html#foundation">Foundation Profile (Ricoh)</a></li>
  <li><a href="cdc-quickstart.html#personal">Personal Profile (Nokia, Sony Ericsson)</a></li>
  <li><a href="cdc-quickstart.html#agui">AGUI (Sun Java Toolkit for CDC)</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="indent"> 
  <h3 class="tutorial">Creating a New CDC Application - Foundation Profile<a name="foundation"></a></h3>
  <p class="tutorial">Here we create a CDC Application, or <em>Xlet</em>,

      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Click Finish. The IDE creates the new application and opens the main class 
      in the Source Editor. The project structure is shown in the following figure. 
      Note that the generated code is based on the profile. In this case, the 
      main class is derived from <code>jp.co.ricoh.dsdk.xlet.Xlet</code>. This 
      profile does not support the Netbeans GUI Designer. <br>
      <br>
      <img src="../../../images/mobility/60/cdcqs/ricohapp.png" width="600" height="502"> 
    </li>

<h2><a name="nsi"></a>Creating a New CDC Application for Windows CE (Using the 
  CrEme VM)</h2>
<p>The NSIcom CrEme VM enables you to create and run Java Swing applications for 
  devices running Windows CE. </p>
<h4>Creating an Application</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Choose File &gt; New Project (Ctrl+Shift+N) from the main window.</li>
  <li>Under Categories, select CDC. Under Projects, select the CDC Application 
    template. Click Next.</li>
  <li>In the Name and Location Page, name the project <code>cremeapp</code>. Click 
    Next. </li>
  <li>In the Select Platform Page, choose pJSCP V4.10. Click Finish. <br>
    <br>
    <img src="../../../images/mobility/60/cdcqs/creme-np.png" width="534" height="339"> 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>In the Explorer window, right-click on the Source Packages node of your 
    project and choose New &gt; JFrame form. Click Finish. The NetBeans GUI Builder 
    (Matisse) displays the new form. <br>
    <br>
    <img src="../../../images/mobility/60/cdcqs/creme-gui.png" width="600" height="472"> 
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Note: Make sure that the first fragment of code in the <code>main()</code> 
      method is as is shown below when you are going to run the application in 
      CrEme default emulator. This  make sure that Swing is loaded. 
    <pre class="examplecode">try {
    UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getCrossPlatformLookAndFeelClassName());<br>} catch(Exception exception) {
    System.out.println(&quot;Error loading L&amp;F: &quot; + exception);
} </pre>
  <li> 
    <p>Use the Project Matisse GUI builder to create your application. You can 
      use the Project Matisse GUI Builder in the same way you use it for regular 
      J2SE development. </p>
    <p>Note that if there is an exception that crashes the emulator, the emulator 
      prints it to the standard output window and waits for a key press. You cannot, 
      however, send the keypress from the IDE. You must instead kill the VM from 
      the Process Explorer. </P>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Compiling and Running the Application on a Device or Emulator</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Connect your mobile device using cable or Bluetooth. <br>

<h2 class="tutorial"><a name="configurations"></a>Using Configurations</h2>
<p>You can use configurations to create more than one set of distribution JAR 
  and Java Application Descriptor (JAD) files for your project. This enables you 
  to create one set of source code and customize it for each mobile device you're 
  programming for.</p>
<p>The instructions below are generalized, but work for each of the platforms 
  previously described. </p>
<div class="indent"> 
  <h3 class="tutorial"><strong>Adding a Configuration</strong></h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Right-click the Project node and choose Properties. In the Properties 
      dialog, Choose Add Configuration from the Project Configuration drop-down 
      list. This opens the Add Configuration dialog.</li>
    <li>Enter a name for your configuration in the Configuration Name field. The 
      name should identify the target platform on which you deploy the JAR/JAD 
      created for this configuration. For this example, enter <code>BlackWhiteDisplay</code> 
      and click OK. You have just created a new configuration.</li>
    <li>Configurations can also be added by clicking the Manage Configurations 
      button in the Properties dialog. This brings up the Project Configuration 
      Manager dialog which contains options for adding, removing, or duplicating 
      configurations.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 class="tutorial"><strong>Customizing a Configuration</strong></h3>
  <p>You can add as many configurations as you would like to your project. You 
    can then modify settings in the Project Properties dialog for each configuration 
    that you've added.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Right-click the Project node and choose Properties. In the Properties 
      dialog, choose the Platform node. </li>
    <li>Choose the <code>BlackWhiteDisplay</code> configuration from the configuration 
      combo box at the top of the Properties dialog. </li>
    <li>The components in the Platform dialog are all disabled. This is because 
      this configuration is currently taking the values used by the default configuration 
      for this panel. Uncheck the Use Values from &quot;DefaultConfiguration&quot; 
      option at the top of the panel. All components on this panel can now be 
      edited. </li>
    <li>Change the Device option to DefaultGrayPhone.</li>
    <li>Toggle the Project Configuration dialog at the top of the Properties dialog 
      and observe that the Device option changes based on which configuration 
      is currently selected. This method of configuration customization works 
      for each panel (other than the general panel) in the dialog. Click OK to 
      save your configuration changes and exit the Properties dialog.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 class="tutorial"><strong>Creating an Ability</strong></h3>
  <p>An <em>Ability</em> is a specific attribute of a project configuration. It 
    can be a physical attribute such as screen size, or an API or JSR supported 
    by the configuration. You can create a new ability and associate it with one 
    or more project configurations. You can then use preprocessior code blocks 
    to associate certain code with that ability. If you later need to add or remove 
    configurations, you won't have to go through all your code and associate the 
    configuration with each code block. Instead, you need only to add that ability 
    to the configuration. The configuration is then automatically associated with 
    any code block that is associated with the ability.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Right-click on the project node and choose Properties.</li>
    <li>Choose the Abilities page from the Category menu tree.</li>
    <li>Choose a configuration from the Project Configuration dropdown menu. This 
      is the configuration with which the ability is associated.</li>
    <li>If necessary, uncheck the Use Values from "DefaultConfiguration" checkbox.</li>
    <li>Click the Add button. <br />
      This opens the Add Ability dialog.</li>
    <li>In the New Ability dialog, enter a name for the ability, or choose an 
      ability from the drop-down menu. Optionally, enter a value for the ability.<br />
      Click Ok to close the New Ability dialog. The ability is now associated 
      with the selected project configuration.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>You can associate the ability with other configurations by choosing a different 
    configuration from the Project Configuration menu and clicking the Add button.</p>
  <h3 class="tutorial">Running Configurations</h3>
  <p>Configurations can be built and run individually or multiple configurations.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Right-click the Project node and choose Run. </li>
    <li>Use the configuration combo box in the Toolbar to change the configuration. 
      Choose Run again. </li>
    <li>Two emulators appear, one for each configuration. </li>
  </ol>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div class="indent">To build multiple configurations simultaneously, right-click 
      on a project and choose Batch Build. In the dialog that opens, check the 
      box next to each configuration you want to build. </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class="indent">To test a device on the fly, right-click on the project 
      and choose Run With. In the dialog that opens, choose the emulator platform 
      and device you want to run. </div>
