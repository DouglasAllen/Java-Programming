    <a name="test"></a>Testing a BPEL Process
</h2>
<p>
     Testing a deployed business process application involves using test cases that act as remote partner services which send SOAP messages to the BPEL Service Engine runtime.
</p>
<p>
     In simple words, the interaction process is the following: The BPEL Service Engine runtime receives the SOAP message and creates an instance of the BPEL process and starts executing the instance. A BPEL process can have many running instances. The BPEL Service Engine runtime receives a message and, using correlation, routes it to the appropriate instance of the process. If an instance does not yet exist, a new instance is created.</p>
<p>
     To test-run a deployed business process application, you need to configure test cases to act as remote partner services sending SOAP messages to the BPEL Service Engine runtime.

    <p>
        <b>To add a test case and bind it to a BPEL operation:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
             In the IDE Projects window, open the Composite Application project to expose its Test folder.
        </li>
        <li>
             Right-click Test, and choose pop-up menu item New Test Case.
            <br>
             This launches the New Test Case wizard.
        </li>
        <li>
             In the Enter the Test Case Name step, enter a name for the test case and click Next.
        </li>
        <li>
             In the Select the WSDL Document step, open the BPEL Module project, select the <tt>.wsdl</tt> file containing the operation you want to test, and then click Next.</li>
        <li>
             In the next step, select the operation you want to test, and then click Finish.
            <br>
             In the project tree, under Test, a new folder is created in the form of an upper case T, containing two files: <tt>Input.xml</tt> and <tt>Output.xml</tt>.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
         <b>Note</b>: If you view the test case in the Files window, you  see <tt>Concurrent.properties</tt> as a third file.    </p>
    <h3 class="tutorial">
        <a name="SettingProps"></a> Setting the Test Properties
    </h3>
    <p>
        <b>To set the test properties:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
             In the Projects window, under the Composite Application project's node, right-click the node for the test case and choose Properties from the pop-up menu.        </li>
        <li>
             Set the properties of the test case as follows:

                <dd>
                    Each thread can invoke the test case multiple times (see the following property). Thus, if conc=2 and inv=3, the test case will be run 6 times (two threads, each run thrice).                </dd>

        <li>
             In the Projects window, expand the Test node and the node for a specific test case. </li>
        <li>Right-click <tt>Input.xml</tt> and click Edit. </li>
        <li>
             Modify the contents as needed. For example, wherever you see <tt>&lt;value&gt;?string?&lt;/value&gt;</tt> click within <tt>?string?</tt> and replace it with a string of any length. However, within such strings, do not include the characters <b>&lt;</b> (less-than sign) or <b>&amp;</b> (ampersand) unless you use them with  XML semantics.        </li>
        <li>
             When you are satisfied, click Save.        </li>
        <li>
             Right-click <tt>Output.xml</tt> and click Edit to examine the contents:
             <ul>
                <li>
                    It is empty. This is a special state that triggers a special operation when the test is run.                </li>
                <li>
                    Each time the test is run, the current output is compared to the contents of <tt>Output.xml</tt>. If any differences are detected, they will be stored in the <tt>Actual_<em>yymmddhhmmss</em>.xml</tt> file under the test case folder. However, in the special case where <tt>Output.xml</tt> starts null, then the output is written to <tt>Output.xml</tt>.                </li>
                <li>
                    In each run after the first, assuming <tt>Output.xml</tt> is no longer null, its contents are preserved. In other words, a previous output is never overwritten by new results.                </li>

      <a name="debug"></a>Debugging BPEL Processes
    </h2>
    <p>
       Debugging BPEL processes follows the same general principles as debugging Java applications. Debugging BPEL processes involves setting breakpoints in the source code and executing the process step-by-step within a debugging session. The BPEL Debugger visually represents the execution of a BPEL process and allows you to view and change variables, monitor the results of executing expressions, and use fault breakpoints tomonitor the state of variables before a fault is thrown.</p>
    <div class="indent">
      <h3 class="tutorial">
         Steps in Debugging BPEL Processes
      </h3>
      <p>
         The main steps in debugging BPEL processes are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Confirm that the GlassFish application server has started.      </li>
        <li>Create test cases.<br>
        For sample processes, test cases are automatically created; for new projects, you need to create at least one test case.</li>
        <li>Open the BPEL process file either in the Source view or Design view.        </li>
        <li>
           Set breakpoints in the code or on the diagram. Optionally, add watches for XPath expressions in your process or add fault breakpoints.    </li>
        <li>
           Start a debugging session. Watch the BPEL Debugger Console window for confirmation that the debugging session has started.        </li>
        <li>
           Within the debugging session, run one or several test cases.</li>
        <li>View execution of  BPEL processes on the diagram in the Design view or in the BPEL Process Execution window and view running instances of BPEL processes in the BPEL Process Instances window. </li>
        <li>
        When an instance stops at a breakpoint, step through the code or the diagram, examine the values of variables in the BPEL Variables window, or observe the values of XPath expressions in the Watches window. </li>
        <li>
           Finish the debugging session.        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class="tutorial">
         Starting and Finishing a BPEL Debugging Session
      </h3>
      <p>A debugging session begins when you connect the BPEL Debugger to the BPEL Service Engine. Only one debugging session can be running with the BPEL Service Engine at a given time. </p>
      <p>After a BPEL debugging session starts, you can execute process instances step-by-step, inspecting the values of BPEL variables and XPath expressions in the BPEL Variables and Watches windows. You can monitor the execution of a BPEL process within a debugger session on the diagram in the Design view: the activities that are being executed are highlighted on the diagram as the current execution position advances. The BPEL Process Execution window also shows the execution of the BPEL process. </p>
      <p>
        <b>To prepare the debugging environment:</b>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           In the Services window, make sure that the GlassFish V2 Application Server is running. The Application Server is running if it has subnodes and is marked with a green triangle.<br>
           If the server is not started, right-click it and choose Start from the pop-up menu. For details about how to start the Application Server, see the <a href="bpel-guide-overview.html#bpelse">BPEL Service Engine </a>section. <br>
       <div>
                <p align="center"><img src="../../../images/articles/ep-bpel-guide/60/asrun.png" alt="Application Server is running"></p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <strong>To start a debugging session on the BPEL Engine:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>In the Projects window, right-click the Composite Applications project you want to debug and choose Debug Project (BPEL) from the pop-up menu.<br>
          The IDE  establishes a debug session on the BPEL Service Engine. Watch 
          the BPEL Debugger Console window for confirmation. 
          The connection might take some time to complete. When it is successfully completed, you can see the new session in the Sessions window and the following messages in the BPEL Debugger Console:<br>
      <tt>11:35:17 Connecting to localhost:3343<br>
      11:36:19 Debug session started</tt></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that the Debug Project (BPEL) command performs the following actions:</p>
         
      <ul>
        <li>Enables debugging with the BPEL Service Engine (sets the <tt>DebugEnabled</tt> property of the BPEL Service Engine to <tt>true</tt>) </li>
        <li>Builds  the Composite Application project and all JBI Modules added to this project </li>
        <li>Deploys the Composite Application project to the BPEL Service Engine</li>
        <li>Starts the debugging session by connecting the BPEL Debugger to the BPEL Service Engine </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Therefore, whenever you start a debugging session you can be sure that the latest version of the BPEL process is deployed on the BPEL Service Engine. </p>
      <p>Now you can run a test case and monitor the execution of the BPEL process until it stops or reaches a breakpoint. As the process advances, the current context is displayed on the diagram and in the BPEL Process Execution window. </p>
      <p>
         If you have several debugging sessions (you may have a Java debugging session running at the same time) and want to change the current session, double-click the name of this session in the Sessions window. Alternatively, right-click the session you want to make current and select Make current.      This session becomes current and the BPEL Process Instances, Watches and BPEL Variables windows are updated to show the data related to the new current session.
      </p>
      <p>
         When you want to finish a debugging session, open the pop-up menu for the session you want to stop and choose Finish in the Sessions window or select Finish Debugger Session on the toolbar. A message that the debugging session is finished is displayed in the BPEL Debugger Console.
      </p>
      <p>
         To finish all debugging sessions, in the Sessions window, right-click any session and choose Finish All.</p>

         Using Breakpoints to Debug BPEL Processes
      </h3>
      <p>
         Breakpoints are used to instruct the debugger to suspend execution of a process at that place in the source code. When a BPEL process reaches a breakpoint, it becomes suspended and you can perform debugging operations, such as examining the values of variables or stepping into your code.
      </p>
      <p>
        To view and organize all breakpoints currently set in the IDE, open the Breakpoints window by choosing Windows &gt; Debugging &gt; BPEL &gt; Breakpoints (Alt-Shift-5). </p>
      <p>
        <b>To debug a process instance that has reached a breakpoint</b>:
      </p>
      <p>
         Once the execution of a process instance is suspended, choose the following commands from the Run menu or on the toolbar:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Continue (Ctrl-F5).</b> Causes the current process instance to run until 
            it encounters the next breakpoint or until the instance completes. The state of the instance changes to Running. </li>
          <li><b>Step Into (F7).</b> Steps to the next BPEL activity. As you step, the current line indicator advances, the current position is highlighted on the diagram, and the contents of 
            the BPEL Debugger windows  change accordingly. The step is 
            supported only at the granularity of an &quot;activity&quot; in BPEL language terms, not at a finer 
            granularity. </li>
          <li><b>Run to Cursor (F4)</b>. Runs the BPEL process to the position selected in the Navigator window (BPEL Logical View), on the diagram (in the Design view) or to the cursor location in the Source view. When the location of the cursor is reached, the process instance becomes suspended. </li>
          </ul>
      <p>
         You can remove a breakpoint from the BPEL source code by placing the cursor at the line with the breakpoint and choosing Run &gt; Toggle Breakpoint, or clicking the left margin of the line that contains the breakpoint. Alternatively, on the diagram, you can right-click the element that has a breakpoint and choose Toggle Breakpoint from the pop-up menu.      </p>

 <h3 class="tutorial">Monitoring Execution of BPEL Processes
    </h3>
	<p> When a running process reaches a breakpoint, the Design view highlights the current position of the debugger and uses colors to differentiate between the states of BPEL activities. As the process advances, the colors and icons for the activities on the diagram are updated to reflect the execution progress. </p>
	<p>On the diagram, the following notation is used:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Green color (glowing). The breakpoint set for the activity is reached.</li>
	  <li>Gray color (grayed-out effect). The activity has never been executed.</li>
	  <li>Green triangle. The activity is now being executed. </li>
	  <li>Blue triangle. The activity has been successfully completed. </li>

	  <h2>         <a name="debugwindows"></a>BPEL Debugger Windows      </h2>
      <p>
         When a debugging session starts, the IDE displays debugger windows below the IDE editing area. The Sessions, BPEL Process Instances, BPEL Variables, and BPEL Process Execution windows contain information related to BPEL processes running within the current debugging section.</p>
      <p> If a debugger window is not displayed, choose Window &gt; Debugging &gt; BPEL &gt; <i>window-name</i> (for example, Window &gt; Debugging &gt; BPEL &gt; BPEL Variables). </p>
      <p>
         The Breakpoints and Watches are standard IDE debugger windows. They display all breakpoints and watches set in the IDE.</p>
      <div class="indent">
	  <h3 class="tutorial">Sessions Window</h3>
  <p>The Sessions window lists all open debugging sessions, including Java and BPEL debugging sessions.  For the BPEL Service Engine, only one session can be started. However, the Sessions window also displays other open debugging sessions, such as Java sessions. Only one of the open debugging sessions can be current, and it is shown in bold. Other debugger windows, such as BPEL Process Instances, BPEL Process Execution, and BPEL Variables, display  data related only to the current debugging session. </p>
      <p>You can perform the following actions on sessions available in the pop-up menu: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Make current.</b> Makes the selected session current. </li>
