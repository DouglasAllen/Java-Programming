   </h2>
      <br>
   <div class="indent">
     <p>
             The Invoke element enables the business process to invoke a one-way or request-response operation on a <tt>portType</tt> offered by a partner. It enables the business process to send messages to partners. The operation is defined in the partner's WSDL file.         </p>
         <h3 class="tutorial">
             Usage         </h3>
         <ol>
            <li>In the Design view, drag the Invoke element from the Palette to the diagram.            </li>
            <li>
               Perform one of the following procedures to associate the Invoke element with a Partner Link element:
                 <ul>
                  <li>
                   Directly draw a message flow from the Invoke element to the target Partner Link.</li>
                  <li>
                     Double-click the Invoke element. A dialog opens where you can examine or change the following:
                       <ul>
                     <li>
                        The name of the Invoke element.                     </li>
                     <li>
                        The partner link that is invoked.                     </li>
                     <li>
                        The operation associated with the Invoke element.                     </li>
                     <li>
                        The input variable associated with the Invoke element.                     </li>
                     <li>
                        The output variable.
                        <br>
                        Both input and output variables can be created or browsed through this dialog.                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p align="center">

              </ul>
           </li>
         </ol>
<p>    In the Property Editor dialog box, you can either create a variable or use an existing variable to hold input and output data. Click the Create button to create a variable for the Invoke element, and click Browse to choose an existing variable. </p>
         <p>
             Note that when you click the Browse button, the Input Variable Chooser or the Output Variable Chooser dialog boxes opens. In these dialog boxes, a checkbox with the option to show variables with appropriate types appears. This checkbox restricts the list of available variables to those which are of the proper type for the activity you are configuring. In this way the Design view helps you develop valid BPEL code.         </p>

             Correlations         </h3>
         <p>
             Correlation sets on invoke activities, which deal with outbound operations, are used to validate that outgoing messages contain data which is consistent with the data contained within specified correlation set instances.         </p>
<p>
             The Correlations tab in the Invoke Property Editor dialog box enables you to examine or specify a correlation set. </p>
         <p align="center">

         </ul>
         <p>
            You can add a correlation set by clicking the Add button.         </p>
         <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="defcorset"></a>
             Defining a Correlation Set and Adding a Correlation Set to an Element         </h3>
         <p>
             Correlation is the means by which the BPEL runtime tracks conversations between a particular process instance and corresponding instances of its partner services. You can think of correlation as a primary key that is used by the BPEL runtime to correlate incoming and outgoing messages and route them accordingly.         </p>
         <p>
             A correlation set is a collection of properties used by the BPEL runtime to identify the correct process to receive a message. Each property in the correlation set may be mapped to an element in one or more message types through property aliases.         </p>
         <p>
             To define a correlation set, messages from partner services must have properties and property aliases defined in the partner WSDL file. You can add properties and property aliases to a WSDL file using the <a href="../websvc/wsdl-guide.html">WSDL Editor</a> or the <a href="bpel-guide-views.html#navigator">Navigator</a>.         </p>
<p>
             After properties and property aliases are added to the WSDL file associated with the process, you can define correlation sets for the Process element.         </p>
         <p>
            <b>To define a correlation set:</b>         </p>
<ol>
            <li>
                In the Design view, right-click the Process element and choose Add &gt;  Correlation Set. The Add Correlation Set dialog box appears.            </li>
            <li>
                Change the name for the correlation set and click Add to add properties.            </li>
            <li>
                In the Property Chooser dialog box, expand the WSDL file node, select a property to add to the set, and click OK.
                  <br>
     Note that by default, the Property Chooser   dialog box only shows those files that have   already been referenced in the process. However, the project may contain   other <tt>.wsdl</tt> and <tt>.xsd</tt> files which have not yet been imported into the   process. If you select a property that is defined in a   non-imported file, the IDE will automatically add the required import to   the BPEL process. </li>
     </ol>
         <p>
             After defining the correlation set as outlined above, add the correlation set to Invoke, Receive, or Reply elements. You can also associate a correlation set with the On Message branch of a Pick activity and with an On Event element within an Event Handlers container. </p>
         <p>
             The following shows a correlation set as seen in the Navigator.         </p>
         <p align="center">
            <img src="../../../images/articles/ep-bpel-guide/60/nav_corr.png" alt="Correlation Set in Navigator">         </p>
         <p>
            <b>To add a correlation set to an element:</b>         </p>
         <ol>
            <li>
                In the Design view, double-click an element (Invoke, Receive, Reply, the On Message branch of Pick or the On Event element within an Event Handlers container).            </li>
            <li>
                In the Property Editor dialog box, select the Correlations tab and click Add.            </li>
            <li>
                In the Choose a Correlation Set dialog box, select the correlation set and click OK.            </li>
            <li>Choose the initiate attribute for this correlation set from the Initiate drop-down list. You can select one of the following options: <br>
                <ul>
                  <li><tt><b>Yes</b>.</tt> The activity must attempt to initiate the correlation set.</li>
                  <li><tt><b>Join</b></tt>. The activity must attempt to initiate the correlation set if the correlation set is not yet initiated.</li>
                  <li><tt><b>No.</b></tt> The activity must not attempt to initiate the correlation set. This is the default option. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Specify the message pattern, which can be <tt>request</tt>, <tt>response</tt>, or <tt>request-response</tt> operations. </li>
            <li>Click OK.            </li>
         </ol>

                           The partner link (<tt>Travel</tt>).</li>
                        <li>
                           The operation associated with the Receive element (<tt>buildItinerary</tt>).                        </li>
                        <li>
                           The input variable to the Receive element (<tt>ItineraryIn</tt>). <br>
                          Select Browse for the Input Variable to open the Input Variable chooser, where you can choose other variables associated with this process. Select Create to create a new variable.                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Create Instance. If selected, an instance of the BPEL process starts when an associated message arrives. Note that if the Receive activity is the first activity in your business process, the Create Instance checkbox must be selected.

      </h2>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>
             Partner Link elements identify the parties that interact with your business process. Each link is defined by a partner link type and a role name.
        </p>
         <h3 class="tutorial">
             Partner Link Types and Roles
         </h3>
         <p>
             The type determines the relationship between a process and its partners by defining the roles played by each service in a conversation. The relationship is further determined by specifying the port type provided by each service to receive messages. Each role specifies one port type in the WSDL file.
        </p>
         <p>
             Roles determine the conversational aspect of this process or its partner. You use a single role for a synchronous operation as the results are returned using the same operation. You use two roles in an asynchronous operation as the partner role switches during a callback.
         </p>
         <p>
            It is easy to confuse partner links and partner link types, however:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Partner link types and roles are special WSDL extensions defined by the BPEL specification. As such, they are defined in WSDL files, not in the process BPEL file.
            </li>
            <li>
               Partner Link is a BPEL 2.0 element. It is defined in the process BPEL file.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
             Partner link types are prerequisites to the Partner Link element definition. A Partner Link element can only be defined by referring to a particular partner link type and role which, as mentioned, must be defined in a WSDL file.         </p>
         <h3 class="tutorial">
             Usage
         </h3>
         <p>
            To add the Partner Link element to the BPEL process, do one of the following:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Drag the Partner Link element from the Palette to the diagram.            </li>
            <li>
               Drag a WSDL file node from the same project in the Projects window to the diagram.            </li>
            <li>
               Drag a WSDL file node from a different project in the Projects window to the diagram.            </li>
            <li>
               Drag a web service node from an EJB project or a Web Application project in the Projects window to the diagram.            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> When you drag the web service node, the BPEL Designer retrieves the WSDL file from the Application Server. To successfully retrieve the WSDL file, the Application Server has to be running and the web service project must be deployed.         </p>
         <p>
            When you drag the Partner Link element, a WSDL file node, or a web service node to the diagram, the Partner Link Property Editor appears.         </p>
         <h3 class="tutorial">
             The Partner Link Property Editor
         </h3>
         <p>
             The Partner Link Property Editor dialog box enables you to establish partner links for your BPEL processes. </p>
         <p>
             The Partner Link Property Editor is invoked by double-clicking a Partner Link element on the diagram, or right-clicking the Partner Link element and choosing Edit. The Partner Link Property Editor also appears when you drag the Partner Link element, a WSDL file node, or a web service node to the diagram.
         </p>
         <p>
             With the Partner Link Property Editor, you can specify:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               The Partner Link name
        </li>
            <li>
               The WSDL file associated with the Partner Link
            </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
            Further on you can choose whether to use the existing partner link type or create a new partner link type.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the WSDL file you selected contains partner link types, the Use Existing Partner Link Type option is selected and the Partner Link Type drop-down list is populated with the partner link types found in the WSDL file. You can use one of the existing partner link types or select the Use a Newly Created Partner Link Type option to create a new partner link type.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the WSDL file does not contain partner link types, the Use a Newly Created Partner Link Type option is selected.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
               <strong>Use Existing Partner Link Type</strong>
               <div>
                 <ol>
                   <li> Choose the partner link type from the drop-down list. The My Role and/or Partner Role fields are filled in automatically. </li>

         <div>
             <ol>

                 <ul>
                     <li> Add the partner link type to the wrapper WSDL file, as suggested by   the IDE in the Create in File field by default. If you choose this   option, the IDE will automatically create the wrapper WSDL file in   your project structure. You can use wrapper WSDL files when the   original WSDL file is read-only or when you do not want to modify the   original WSDL file. The original WSDL file will be imported to the   newly created wrapper WSDL file. </li>
                          
              
                     <li>Add the partner link type to a WSDL file within your project. Click Browse and locate the WSDL file in which to add the partner link type. </li>
                   </ul></li>
<li>Specify the partner link type name.</li>
                  <li>Specify the role of the business process itself (My Role) and/or the role of the partner (Partner Role) as follows:<br>

When the activities are the source of a link, the condition of the link and the join condition of the activity must be evaluated. If the link conditions that lead to an activity conflict with those of its join condition, then a fault is thrown on that activity.

             The If activity supports conditional behavior of a business process instance. The If activity consists of conditional branches defined by the If and Else If elements, followed by an optional Else branch. The conditions on If and Else If branches are evaluated in the order they appear. During execution, the first branch whose condition holds true is taken and provides the activity specified for the If activity. In other words, if there are several Else If branches whose conditions hold true, only the first of them will be executed.
        </p>
         <p>
            If none of the branches evaluates to true, then the Else path is chosen. If the Else branch is not explicitly specified, this branch is considered to contain an Empty activity. The If activity is complete when the activity of the selected branch completes.

             The Pick element blocks the process and waits until one of the specified events occurs. After the specific event occurs, the activity associated with this event is performed. The possible events are the arrival of a message or a timer-based alarm. The occurrence of the events is mutually exclusive. If more than one of the events occurs, then the selection of the activity to perform depends on which event occurred first.
        </p>
         <p>
             The Pick activity provides two branches, On Message and On Alarm. The branch whose condition is satisfied first (i.e. a message is received or the specified timer expires) is executed. When you add a Pick element to your diagram, it automatically includes one On Message statement in which you specify the properties of the message that the process awaits from a partner service. Each Pick element must include at least one On Message statement. The On Alarm branch contains a timer you can use to specify how long the process is to wait.

             Variables
         </h3>
      <p>
               Variables in BPEL programming function just as they do in other programming languages: they hold temporary values, form parts of expressions, or are passed 
as parameters to external partners. Normally, you need a variable for every message sent to or received from a partner service. The BPEL Designer supports the following types of variables:            </p>
            <ul>
               <li><b>WSDL Message type</b>.     These variables correspond to web service message types that are defined  in WSDL files imported by the process. In a BPEL file (<tt>.bpel</tt>), these variables  must specify a value for the <tt>messageType</tt> attribute. Message  type variables are used to hold data in interactions between the  process and its partner services. </li>
               <li> <b>XML Schema type</b>. These variables correspond to <i>simple</i> or <i>complex</i> XML Schema data types.   The XML schema types themselves are defined in  XML Schema files (<tt>.xsd</tt>) or in WSDL files that are imported into the process. In a BPEL file, variables of this type must specify a value for the <tt>type</tt> attribute. </li>
               <li><b>XML Schema element</b>.     These variables correspond to XML Schema elements.The XML schema  elements themselves are defined in  XML Schema files (<tt>.xsd</tt>) or in WSDL files that are imported into the process. In a BPEL file, variables of this type must specify a value for the <tt>element</tt> attribute.</li>
               <li><b>Built-in type</b>. Variables of this type are standard simple types defined in the XML Schema specification. </li>
     </ul>
            <p>
               <b>Global and Local Variables</b>
            </p>
            <p>
               The variables defined at the Process root are global variables, which  have a global visibility throughout the entire process. The variables  defined within a particular Scope are visible only  inside that Scope and all nested Scopes. These variables are called  local variables. A variable defined for an inner Scope element can hide  an upper defined variable of the same name.
            </p>
            <p>
               The name of a variable must be unique among the names of all variables defined within the same Scope.
            </p>
            <p><strong>To define a  variable:</strong></p>
         <ol>
                  <li>Right-click the Process or Scope element and select Add &gt; Variable.</li>
                  <li>In the Create New Variable dialog box, name the variable. The name should be unique within this Scope element.</li>
                  <li>Expand the node corresponding to the type of the new variable and select its type. You have the following options:
                     <ul>
                        <li><b>Built-in Types</b>. Expand the Built-in Types node, select the type's name, and click OK. </li>
                        <li><b>Message Type</b>. Expand a <tt>.wsdl</tt> file node, select a message type and click OK. </li>
                        <li><b>XML Schema</b>. Expand an <tt>.xsd</tt> file node or a <tt>.wsdl</tt> file that contains an embedded schema. Expand the Global Complex Type, Global Simple Type, or Global Elements Simple nodes, select the appropriate type, and click OK. <br>
                        For your convenience,  global types of variables are displayed in bold. </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>(Optional) Clear the Show Imported Files Only checkbox to view the contents of non-imported WSDL and XML schema files.                  </li>
                  <li>Click OK.</li>
     </ol>
                  <p>By default, the Create New Variable dialog box only shows those files that have   already been referenced in the process. However, the project may contain   other WSDL and XSD files which have not yet been imported into the   process. If you select a type for the new variable that is defined in a   non-imported file, the IDE will automatically add the required import to   the BPEL process.                   </p>
                  <p>
                     You can also add variables from the <a href="bpel-guide-views.html#navigator">Navigator</a> window. To add a variable, select BPEL Logical View in the Navigator, expand your BPEL Module project's node, right-click the Variables node and choose Add Variable.
                  </p>

             Processes
         </h3>
         <p>
             A BPEL process can be synchronous or asynchronous. A synchronous BPEL process blocks the client (the one which is using the process) until the process finishes and returns a result to the client. An asynchronous process does not block the client. Rather it uses a callback to return the result (if any). Usually we use asynchronous processes for longer-lasting processes and synchronous for processes that return a result in a relatively short time. If a BPEL process uses asynchronous web services, the process itself is usually also asynchronous.

             Use the Repeat Until element to repeatedly execute one or more activities as long as specific conditions are in place after the execution of each iteration. This element contains other elements that are repeated until the success criteria you specify are met. If the condition you specify leads to true, the activities listed will be executed once.

            <strong>Note:</strong> the Repeat Until element first executes the iterative activity and then checks the validity of the condition. Conversely, the <a href="bpel-guide-palette.html#usingwhileelement">While</a> element first checks the validity of the condition and then executes the activity.

             Usage

         <ol>
            <li>
                In the Design view, drag the For Each element from the Palette to the diagram.            </li>
            <li>
                Add elements that will be repeatedly executed from the Palette into the For Each element. The elements that you add are automatically wrapped into the Scope element.            </li>
            <li>
                Right-click the For Each element and choose Properties to open its Properties window.            </li>
         </ol>
         <p>
             The Properties window for the For Each element includes the properties listed below.
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Name</b>. Specifies the name of the For Each element.            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Counter Variable Name</b>. Declares the counter variable name.            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Start Counter Value</b>. Sets the start counter value. Use the <a href="bpel-guide-mapper.html">BPEL Mapper</a> to generate an integer value expression.            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Final Counter Value</b>. Sets the final counter value. Use the <a href="bpel-guide-mapper.html">BPEL Mapper</a> to generate an integer value expression.
               <br>
                When the For Each activity is started, the expressions in Start Counter Value and Final Counter Value are evaluated for the first and only time. That is, once the two values are returned they remain constant for the lifespan of the activity. If the Start Counter Value is greater than the Final Counter Value, then no iteration will be performed.
           </li>
            <li>
                <b>Completion Condition</b> (Optional). Specifies an integer value expression. After execution of each directly enclosed activity, the number of completed activities is checked against this value. When the number of completed activities equals the value of the specified expression, no further activities are started. When the expression value is greater than the available number of iterations, then no iteration will be started.            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Count Completed Branches Only</b> (Optional). If this checkbox is selected, it tells the runtime to only count the branches that have completed successfully. If this checkbox is cleared, all branches, completed successfully or unsuccessfully, will be counted. </li>
