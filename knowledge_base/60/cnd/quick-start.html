	<h2><A NAME="requirements"></a>Requirements</h2>
	<p>You must have the following software installed before you can
	start C or C++ development: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>NetBeans IDE 6.0</li>
		<li>NetBeans C/C++ pack</li>
		<li>GNU C and C++ compilers, <tt>make</tt>, and <tt>gdb</tt> (Windows platform); GNU C and C++
		compilers, or Sun C and
		C++ compilers, <tt>make</tt>, and <tt>gdb</tt> (Solaris and Linux Platforms)
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>See the <a href="../../../community/releases/60/install.html">NetBeans IDE
	6.0 Installation
	Instructions</a> and the <a
	HREF="../../../community/releases/60/cpp-setup-instructions.html">Installing
	and Configuring C/C++ Support</a> for
	information on downloading and installing the required software. 
	</p>
	<p><BbSample Projects</b> 
	</p>
	<p>Just want to play with some projects? In the IDE, choose
	File&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;New Project, then open the Samples category, the
	C/C++  subcategory, and the C/C++ subcategory. The IDE
	provides several sample C and C++ projects to help you familiarize
	yourself with the IDE. 
	</p>
	<h2><a name="projects"></a>Creating C and C++ Projects</h2>
<p>NetBeans C/C++ support lets you create C and C++ Application
and Library projects with generated makefiles, as well as C and C++ projects 
from existing code.
</p>
<p>
With a C/C++ Application, Dynamic Library, or Static Library project, the 
IDE controls all aspects 
of how your application is built, run, and debugged. You specify project settings  
when creating the project and in the Project Properties dialog box. The IDE 
generates a makefile in which all of your settings are stored.
</p>
<div class="indent">
<h3><a name="CreatingApp"></a>Creating a C/C++ Application Project</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Open the New Project wizard by choosing File &gt; New Project.</li><br>
    <li>In the wizard, select the C/C++ category.</li><br>
    <li>
	The wizard gives you a choice of four types of new projects: 
	C/C++ Project From Existing
	Code, C/C++ Application,
	C/C++ Dynamic Library, and C/C++ Static Library. 
	Select C/C++ Application and click Next.
    </li>
    <br>
    <img src="../../../images/articles/60/cnd/quickstart/CreatingApplication.png" alt="Screenshot of the New Project
    Wizard">
    <br><br>
    <li>
	Create a new C/C++ Application project from the wizard using the defaults. 
	You can choose the name of the project and the location of the project.
    </li><br>
    <li>Click Finish to exit the wizard.</li>
</ol>
<p>
A project is created with four logical folders. 
A logical folder is not a directory. It is a way for you to organize your
files and does not 
reflect where the files are physically stored on disk. Files added to logical 
folders are automatically part of the project and are compiled when you build 
the project.
</p>
<p>
Files added to the Important Files folder are not part of the project and are 
not compiled when you build the project. These files are just for reference 
and are convenient when you have a project with an existing makefile. 
</p>
<div class="indent">
<h3><a name="SwitchingViews"></a>Switching Between the Logical View and the Physical View of the Project</h3>
<p>A project has both a logical and a physical view.
You can switch between the logical view and the physical view of your
project.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
	Select the Files tab. This window shows the physical view of your
	project. It displays files and folders as they are stored on disk.
    </li>
    <br>
    <img src="../../../images/articles/60/cnd/quickstart/FilesTab.png" alt="Screenshot of the Files tab"> 
    <br><br>
    <li>
	Select the Projects tab. This window shows the logical view of 
	your project. 
    </li>
    <br>
	<img src="../../../images/articles/60/cnd/quickstart/ProjectsTab.png" alt="Screenshot of the Projects tab">
    </ol>

<h3><a name="AddingFilesandFolders"></a>Adding Files and Folders to Your Project</h3>
<p>You can add logical folders to your project.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
	Right-click the project node of your Application project 
	and choose New Logical Folder. A new logical folder is added to the project.
    </li><br>
    <li>
	Right-click the new logical folder and select Rename. Type the name
	you would like to give the new folder.
    </li>

</ol>
<p>You can add both
files and folders to an existing folder. Logical folders can be nested.
</p>
<h3><a name="AddingNewFiles"></a>Adding New Files to Your Project</h3>
<p>You can add new files to your project.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Right-click the Source Files folder and choose New.</li><br>
    <li>
	Choose Main C File from the submenu.
    </li>
    <li>On the Name and Location page of the New File dialog box, type <tt>main</tt> in the File Name field.
        <img src="../../../images/articles/60/cnd/quickstart/AddingFiles.png" alt="Screenshot of the New File dialog
        box"></li>
<li>Click Finish.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The <tt>main.c</tt> file is created on disk in the
directory specified in the wizard and added to the Source Files folder. You
can add any kind of file to this folder, not only source files. 
</p>
<h3"><a name="MoreNewFiles"></a>Adding More New Files to Your Project</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Right-click the Header Files folder and choose New.</li><br>
    <li>
	Choose C Header File from the submenu.
    </li><br>
    <li>On the Name and Location page of the New File dialog box, type <tt>file</tt> in the File Name field.</li><br>

    <li>Click Finish.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The file is created on disk in the directory specified in the wizard 
and added to the Header Files folder.
</p> 
<h3><a name="AddingExistingFiles"></a>Adding Existing Files to Your Project</h3>
<p>
You can add existing files to your project in two ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
	Right-click the Source Files folder and choose Add Existing Item. 
	You can point to an existing file on disk using the Select Item
	dialog box and add the file to the project.
    </li>
    <li>Right-click the Source Files folder and choose Add Existing Items from
    Folders. Use the Add Files dialog box to add folders that contain existing
    files.
</ul>

<p>
Do not use New menu item to add existing items. The Name and Location panel
will tell you the file already exists.
</p>
<h3><a name="ProjectProperties"></a>Setting Project Properties</h3>
<p>
<p>When the project is created, it has two configurations, Debug and Release. 
A configuration is the project's way of storing the current settings.
The Debug configuration builds a version of your application that includes
debug information.
The Release configuration builds an optimized version.
</p>
<p>The Project Properties dialog box contains build and configuration information
for your project. To open the Project Properties dialog box:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
	Right-click the project node of the 
	<tt>Application_1</tt> project and choose Properties.
    </li>
    <br>
    <img src="../../../images/articles/60/cnd/quickstart/ProjectProperties.png" alt="Screenshot of the Project
    Properties dialog box">
</ul>

<p>
You can modify the compiler settings and other configuration settings in the
Project Properties dialog box by selecting a node in the left panel and modifying 
the properties in the right panel. Select some of the nodes and property 
values and notice the properties you can set. You are setting properties
in the currently selected configuration.
<h3><a name="Configurations"></a>Managing Configurations</h3>
<p>Properties changed in the Project Properties window are stored in the
makefile for the current configuration. You can edit the default configurations 
or create new ones. To create a new configuration:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
	Click the Manage Configurations button in the Project Properties
	dialog box.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li> 
	In the Configurations dialog box, select the configuration which most
	closely matches your desired configuration. In this case, select the
	Release configuration and click the Copy button. Then click Rename.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
	In the Rename dialog box, rename the 
	configuration to PerformanceRelease. Click OK. 
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Click OK in the Configurations dialog box.</li>
    <br>
    <li>
	In the Project Properties dialog box, note that the PerformanceRelease
	configuration is selected in the Configuration drop-down list.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
	In the left panel, expand the C/C++ node, 
	and then the GNU C Compiler node, and select the General node. 
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
	In the property sheet in the right panel, change the Development
	Mode from Release to PerformanceRelease. Click OK.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
You have created a new configuration that will compile the application with a 
different set of options.
</p>

<h3><a name="FileProperties"></a>Setting Source File Properties</h4>
<p>
<p>When you set the project properties for your C or C++ project, the relevant 
properties apply to all files in the project. You can set some 
properties for a specific file.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
	Right-click the <tt>main.c</tt> source file
	and choose Properties. You can override the project compiler settings
	and other properties on a per file basis. You can also exclude files
	from a build in a specific configuration.
    </li><br>

    <li>Cancel the Project Properties dialog box.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="SettingMainProject"></a>Setting the Main Project</h3>
<p>
When you right-click a project node in the Projects window,
you get a pop-up menu of actions you can perform on the selected project.
If you have multiple projects open at the same time, the pop-up menu
for a project node implies you are operating on that project.
But what about project-related actions on the menubar and toolbar?
</p>
<p>
Most of the project-related actions on the menubar and toolbar operate on the
main project. The main project node is displayed in bold text in the
Project window.
<p>
To change the main project in the IDE:
<ul>
    <li>
	Right-click the desired project node and choose Set as Main Project.
	This project is now the main project in the IDE 
	and actions in the menubar and toolbar refer to this project.
    </li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="BuildingProject"></a>Building Your Project</h3>
<p>To build your project:
<ol>
    <li>
	Choose Build &gt; Build Main Project and the project  
	builds. The build output is shown in the Output window.
    </li><br>
    <li>
	Switch the configuration from Debug to PerformanceRelease in the configuration 
	drop-down list in the main toolbar. Now the project will be built using the
	PerformanceRelease configuration.
    </li><br>

    <li>
	Choose Build &gt; Build Main Project and the project 
	builds. The build output is shown in the Output window.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
You can build, clean, or both clean and build the project 
by choosing actions from the Build menu. The project also keeps object
files and executables from different configurations separate, so
you do not have to worry about mixing files from multiple configurations.
</p>
<h3><a name="CompilingFile"></a>Compiling a Single File</h3>
<p>
To compile a single source file:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>

	Right-click on the <tt>main.c</tt> file and choose 
	Compile File. Only this file is compiled.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
Note: Single file compilation is not supported for the project type
C/C++ Project From Existing Code.
</p>
</div>
<h2><a name="running"></a>Running a Project</h2>
<p>
The <tt></tt> program prints command-line arguments. Before running the
program, we will set some arguments in the current configuration. Then we will run
the program.
</p>
<p>
To create the <tt>Args</tt> project, set some arguments, and run the project:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose File &gt; New Project.</li>
<br>
<li>In the project wizard, expand the Samples category and the C/C++ subcategory.</li>
<br>
<li>Select the C/C++ subcategory, then select the <tt>Args</tt> project. Click
Next, then click Finish.
</li>
<br>
<li>Right-click the <tt>Args_1</tt> project node and choose Build Project. The
project builds.</li>
<br>
    <li>Right-click the <tt>Args_1</tt> project node and choose Properties.</li><br>
    <li>In the Project Properties dialog box, select the Running node.</li>
    <br>
    <li>
	In the Arguments text field, type 1111 2222 3333. Click OK.
    </li>
    <br>
    <img src="../../../images/articles/60/cnd/quickstart/SettingArguments.png" alt="Screenshot of the Project Properties
    dialog box">
    <br><br>
    <li>
	Choose Run &gt; Run Main Project. The application runs.
	Your arguments are displayed in the Output window.
    </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<h2><a name="makefileprojects"></a>Creating a C/C++ Project From Existing

The IDE has a dynamic C and C++ code completion feature 
that enables you to type one or more characters and then see a 
list of possible classes, methods, variables, and so on that can be used 
to complete the expression.
<ol>
<li>Open the <tt>quote.cc</tt> file in the <tt>Quote_1</tt> project, and
right-click in the left margin of the Source Editor and choose Show Line
Numbers.
</li>
<br>
<li>On line 19 of the <tt>quote.cc</tt>,
type a capital C and press Ctrl-Space. The code completion box displays a list that includes the
<tt>Customer</tt> class.
</li>
<br>
<img src="../../../images/articles/60/cnd/quickstart/CodeCompletion1.png" alt="Screenshot of code completion
box">
<br><br>
<li>Select the <tt>Customer</tt> class and press Enter.
</li>
<br>
<li>Complete the new instance of the <tt>Customer</tt> class by typing "
<tt>andrew;</tt>". On the next line, type the letter <tt>a</tt> and press
Ctrl-Space. The code completion box displays a list of choices starting with
the letter <tt>a</tt>, such as method
arguments, class fields, and global names, that are accessible from the
current context.
</li>
<br>
<img src="../../../images/articles/60/cnd/quickstart/CodeCompletion2.png" alt="Screenshot of code completion box">
<br><br>
<li>Double-click the <tt>andrew</tt> option to accept it and type a period after it.
You are automatically provided with a list of the public methods and fields
of the <tt>Customer</tt> class.
</li>

<li>Delete the code you have added.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="CodeTemplates"></a>Using Code Templates</h3>
<p>The Source Editor has a set of customizable code templates for common snippets 
of C and C++ code. You can generate the full code snippet by typing its 
abbreviation and pressing the spacebar. For example, in the
<tt>Singleton.cpp</tt> file of the <tt>Loki</tt> project:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Type <tt>uns</tt> followed by a
space. <tt>uns</tt> expands to <tt>unsigned</tt>.</li>
  <br>
   <li>Type <tt>iff</tt> followed by a space.
<tt>iff</tt> expands to <tt>if () {}</tt>.</li>
   <br>
   <li>Type <tt>ife,</tt> followed by a space.
<tt>ife</tt> expands to <tt>if () {} else {}</tt>.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>Type <tt>fori</tt> followed by a
space. <tt>fori</tt> expands to <tt>for (int i = 0; i &lt;
; i++) {}</tt>.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="PairCompletion"></a>Using Pair Completion</h3>
<p>When you edit your C and C++ source files, the Source Editor does "smart" 
matching of pair characters such as brackets, parentheses, and quotation marks. When you type one of these characters, the Source Editor automatically inserts the closing character.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the <tt>Quote_1</tt> project, place the cursor after the <tt>{</tt> 
  on line 92 of the 
  <tt>module.cc</tt> file and press
  Return to go to a new line. 
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>Type <tt>enum state {</tt> and press Return. The closing curly bracket and
  semi-colon are added automatically and the cursor is placed on the line
  between the brackets.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>Type <tt>invalid=0, success=1</tt> to 
  complete the enumeration.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>On the line after the closing <tt>};</tt> of the enumeration, type <tt>if
  (</tt>. The closing parenthesis is added automatically and the cursor is
  placed between the parentheses.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Type <tt>v==null</tt>. Then type <tt> {</tt> and newline after the right
  parenthesis. The closing bracket is added automatically.     

</li>
</ol>
