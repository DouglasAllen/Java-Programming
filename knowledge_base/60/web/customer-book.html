        <h1>Using Java Persistence in a Web Application</h1>
        <p>This document is a basic introduction to using the Java Persistence API in a web application and demonstrates how
            the development process using the Java<sup>TM</sup> Platform, Enterprise Edition 5 ("Java EE 5") technology 
            simplifies the development of Java applications.</p>
            
            <p>In this document you will use NetBeans IDE 6.0 to create 
            a web application that will access a database. 
            In the web application, you will use the IDE to generate entity classes corresponding to tables in a database.
            You will then create a servlet that displays the information in the database.
            The application uses Java Persistence to manage the database transaction.</p>
            <p>To see how the same application was created using Java EE 1.4, see the

<h3 class="tutorial">Prerequisites</h3>
            <p>This document assumes you have some basic knowledge of, or programming experience 
            with, the following technologies:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Java Programming</li>
            <li>NetBeans IDE</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3 class="tutorial">Software Needed for This Tutorial</h3>
            <p>For this tutorial you need to have the following software installed on your computer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Web &amp; Java EE" or "All" download of NetBeans IDE 6.0.</li>
                <li>Java Standard Development Kit (JDK) version 5.0 or version 6.0 </li>
                <li>GlassFish V2 Application Server (bundled with full IDE download) or 
                Sun Java System Application Server Platform Edition 9 (<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/products/appsrvr_pe/index.xml" target="_blank">download</a>)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <!-- ===================================================================================== -->
        <a name="Exercise_0"></a>
        <h2>Configuring the IDE to Use the Application Server</h2>
        <p>For this tutorial you must have an instance of Glassfish V2 or
            the Sun Java System Application Server Platform Edition 9 registered with the IDE.
        In this exercise we will register the application server with the IDE.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose Tools &gt; Server Manager from the main menu.</li>
            <li>Click Add Server. Select your application server (GlassFish or Sun Java System Application Server) and give a name 
            to the instance. Then click Next.</li>
            <li>Specify the installation directory of the application server (for example, <tt>C:\Sun\Appserver</tt>).</li>
            <li>Leave the Register Local Default Domain radio button selected and select a domain.</li>
            <li>Optionally, click Next and enter your administrator username and password. 
            If you do not want to store the username and password in your IDE user directory, you can leave these fields blank. 
            The IDE will prompt you every time it needs the information.<br />
            <b>Note:</b> The default admin password is <tt>adminadmin</tt>.</li>
            <li>Click Finish. The IDE registers the server and lists it under the Servers node in the Runtime window.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="indent">
        <h3 class="tutorial">Summary</h3>
            <p>In this exercise we registered the application server with the IDE. </p>

        <h2><a name="Exercise_1"></a> 
        <!--Exercise 1: -->
        Setting Up the Web Application Project</h2>
        <p>In this example developing for the Java EE 5 platform, we do not need a full enterprise application because we do not 
        need an EJB module or session beans. 
        Instead, we can create a simple web application and put our entity classes directly in the web application.</p>
        <p>When developing for the J2EE 1.4 platform it was necessary to create a full enterprise application 
        and put our entity and session beans in the EJB module.
        We then had to add lookup code to the web module to access the entity beans.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Choose File &gt; New Project (Ctrl-Shift-N). 
            Select Web Application from the Web category. </li>
            <li>Name the project CustomerBook, set the server to GlassFish or Sun Java System Application Server, 
            set the Java EE Version to Java EE 5, and click Finish.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="indent">
            <h3 class="tutorial">Summary</h3>
            <p>In this exercise we created a Java EE 5 web application which will contain the entity classes. </p>
        </div>
        <!-- ===================================================================================== -->
        <a name="Exercise_2"></a>
        <!--Exercise 2: -->
        <h2>Coding the Web Application</h2>
        <p>Generally some basic setup is necessary before you can start coding the web application.
        This would include establishing a connection with the database and creating a connection pool and data source.
        Because we are using the jdbc/sample database that comes bundled with the IDE, much of this is already configured.
        The connection to the database is already registered with the IDE and the connection pool and data source are already created.
        You can view the view the connection and data source properties in the Services window.</p>

        <p>Once the setup is complete, development for the Java EE 5 platform is much easier than before because 
        the container does more of the work.
        Because the container is managing persistence, 
            we do not need to edit any deployment descriptors to configure the CMP mappings or specify the finder methods.
            In fact, in this example we do not need any deployment descriptors at all. 
            In the Java EE 5 platform, persistence is no longer limited to an EJB component. 
            Java EE 5 introduces the Java Persistence API, which can be used by non-EJB components, such as a web application.</p>
            <p>Java EE 5 technology also eliminates the need for a lot of the
            boilerplate code needed in J2EE 1.4 development. EJB development has been streamlined so that fewer interfaces are needed,
            lookup is simpler, and annotations make component definition and resource injection simple and clear.</p>
        
        
            <div class="indent">
            <!-- Persistence -->
            <h3 class="tutorial">Managing Persistence</h3>
            <p>To manage persistence in our application we only need to create a persistence unit, specify which data source and entity manager to use, and 
                then let the container do the work of managing entities and persistence. The container discovers the entity beans at runtime.</p>

            <p>We create a persistence unit by definining it in <tt>persistence.xml</tt>.
            If there is no <tt>persistence.xml</tt> in our project or module, we need to create it.
            We can add a persistence unit to our project with the New Persistence Unit wizard, which will help us create the 
            <tt>persistence.xml</tt> and define the properties of the persistence unit. 
            <b>Note:</b> We can also create a persistence unit in the New Entity Class wizard.
            When creating an entity class, the wizard will prompt us to create a persistence unit if one does not exist.</p>
  
            <ol>
                <li>Choose New File (Ctrl-N) to open the New File wizard.</li>
                <li>From the Persistence category, select Persistence Unit and click Next.</li>
                <li>Leave the default name for the persistence unit suggested by the wizard.</li>
                <li>Use the <tt>TopLink (default)</tt> listed in the Persistence Provider drop-down list.
                <p>The default provider is the <tt>TopLink Essential.jar</tt>. 
                <tt>TopLink Essential.jar</tt> contains the libraries for Java Persistence.
                Our entity manager is located in <tt>TopLink Essential.jar</tt>.</p></li>
                <li>Use the default <tt>jdbc/sample</tt> data source listed in the Data Source drop-down list.
                <p>The default data source <tt>jdbc/sample</tt> is used to connect to the Java DB database that is bundled
                with GlassFish/Sun Java System Application Server.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Click Finish.</li>
            </ol>
            <img src="../../../images/articles/60/web/custbook/custbook-pu.png" width="590" height="304" alt="new persistence unit wizard" style="margin:10px auto;" />

            <p>When you click Finish, <tt>persistence.xml</tt> is created for your project and opens in the Source Editor. 
            You can click XML in the toolbar of the Source Editor to see the XML view of <tt>persistence.xml</tt>.
            This file contains all the information the Java EE 5 container needs to manage the entities 
            and persistence of our application.</p>
                        
            
            <!-- Entity Classes -->
            <h3 class="tutorial">Creating the Entity Classes</h3>
            <p>When developing for the J2EE 1.4 platform, when you created entity beans you placed them in an EJB module 
            even when the application was a simple web application.
            Each entity bean required several interfaces, and you had to configure
            the deployment descriptors in <tt>ejb-jar.xml</tt> to define the entity beans, 
            the interfaces, persistence and finder queries for each entity bean.</p>
            <p>In Java EE 5, instead of creating entity beans and putting them in the EJB module, 
            we can use simple entity classes, and the entity classes can be placed anywhere in a Java EE 5 application. 
            Writing classes for Java EE 5 applications is also easier than it was for the J2EE 1.4 platform because you can use annotations to 
            define components and inject resources. </p>

            <p>We will now use the Entity Classes from Database wizard to create the entity classes based on our relational database.</p>

             
            <ol>
                <li>Start the Java DB database by choosing Tools &gt; Java DB Database &gt; Start Server from the main menu.</li>
                <li>Choose New File (Ctrl-N) to open the New File wizard. 
                Select Entity Classes from Database from the Persistence category and click Next. </li>
                <li>In the Entity Classes from Database wizard, select the <tt>jdbc/sample</tt> data source for our database from the Data Source drop-down list
                and supply the password if necessary. (The password should be "app".)   
                When you select the data source, a list of available tables appears in the Available Tables pane.</li>
                <li>Select the <tt>CUSTOMER</tt> table from the Available Tables and click Add. 
                <p>When you click Add, any tables related to the selected table are also added.
                In this example, the <tt>DISCOUNT_CODE</tt> table is also added. <tt>DISCOUNT_CODE</tt> table is greyed-out because it is referenced
                by <tt>CUSTOMER</tt> table and an entity class for it must be generated in order to generate the <tt>Customer</tt> entity class.
                To see how the greyed-out table is related to the selected table, you can hover your mouse over the table name in the Selected Tables pane.</p>
                
                <li>Click Next. 
                <p>The wizard displays the selected table and any related tables.
                The wizard also displays the entity classes that will be created based on the selected tables.
                If you want to modify the name of the class that will be generated, you can type the name in the Class Name field.</p></li> 
                <li>Specify <tt>ejb</tt> as the package for the generated classes and click Finish. </li>
            </ol>
            <img src="../../../images/articles/javaee5/custbook_entityfromdatabase2.png" width="692" height="503" alt="new entity classes from database wizard" style="margin:10px auto;" />
            <p>When you click Finish, the IDE generates entity classes for the <tt>CUSTOMER</tt> table and the tables related 
            to <tt>CUSTOMER</tt> table. If you expand the <tt>ejb</tt> source package in the Projects window 
            you can see that the IDE created the Java classes <tt>Customer.java</tt> and <tt>DiscountCode.java</tt>.
            You can see that the IDE created only two classes, one for each of the database tables.</p>
            <p>If you look at <tt>Customer.java</tt> in the Source Editor, you will notice that the <tt>@Entity</tt> annotation is
            used to declare the class an entity class. 
            Other annotations provide additional information such as the 
            database table and columns the entity class and its properties are mapped to.</p>
            <p>You will also notice that much of the boilerplate code commonly found in entity beans is gone. 
            Methods such as <tt>ejbRemove</tt>, <tt>setMessage</tt>, <tt>setSessionContext</tt>, <tt>ejbActivate</tt>, and <tt>ejbPassivate</tt> 
            are no longer needed in your entity class in Java EE 5.</p>
            
            
            <h3 class="tutorial">Coding the Servlet</h3>
            <p>We now need to add a servlet to our web application.
            Instead of adding resource creation and lookup code to our servlet, with Java EE 5 we can use resource injection to move that work to the container.
            We can use annotations to inject resources directly into our servlet, and
            the container will manage the creation and lookup of the requested resource.
            In this case, we want to use an entity manager as specified in our persistence unit.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Right-click the project node in the Projects window and choose New &gt; Servlet.</li>
                <li>In the New Servlet wizard, name the servlet <tt>CustomerDetails</tt> and put the servlet into a package named <tt>web</tt>. Click Finish. 
                When you click Finish, <tt>CustomerDetails.java</tt> opens in the Source Editor.</li>
                <li>In the Source Editor, right-click in <tt>CustomerDetails.java</tt> and choose Persistence &gt; Use Entity Manager to 
                inject the PersistenceContext in the class. The IDE adds the following annotation that specifies the persistence unit used by the servlet.
                The annotation is added above the class declaration.
                    <pre class="examplecode">    
  @PersistenceContext(name = &quot;persistence/LogicalName&quot;, unitName = &quot;CustomerBookPU&quot;)
                    </pre>
                <p>The IDE also adds the following annotation injecting a resource for managing transaction boundaries:</p>
                <pre class="examplecode">
  @Resource
  private javax.transaction.UserTransaction utx;</pre>
                <p>If you expand the editor fold you can see that the IDE adds the following default code to the servlet:</p>
                <pre class="examplecode">
  public void persist(Object object) {
      try {
          Context ctx = (Context) new InitialContext().lookup(&quot;java:comp/env&quot;);
          utx.begin();
          EntityManager em =  (EntityManager) ctx.lookup(&quot;persistence/LogicalName&quot;);
          em.persist(object);    
          utx.commit();
      } catch(Exception e) {
          Logger.getLogger(getClass().getName()).log(Level.SEVERE,&quot;exception caught&quot;, e);
          throw new RuntimeException(e);
      }
  }</pre>
                <p>This code looks up the persistence unit defined by <tt>@PersistenceContext</tt> and an instance of the entity manager.</p>
                </li>
                <li>In <tt>CustomerDetails.java</tt>, modify the generated lookup code shown above to refer to our entity object.
                When you are finished, the modified code should look like the following 
                (the code shown in bold indicates the changed lines):
                <pre class="examplecode">
  <b>public Customer findByID(Integer customerNr) {
        Customer customer = null;</b>
        try {
            Context ctx = (Context) new InitialContext().lookup("java:comp/env");
            EntityManager em =  (EntityManager) ctx.lookup("persistence/LogicalName");
            utx.begin();
<b>            customer = em.find(Customer.class, customerNr);
            utx.commit();</b>
        } catch(Exception e) {
            Logger.getLogger(getClass().getName()).log(Level.SEVERE,"exception caught", e);
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
<b>        return customer;</b>
    }              
                </pre>
                </li>
                <li>Uncomment the code in the <tt>processRequest</tt> method and add the following code in bold: 
                    <pre class="examplecode">    protected void processRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
        throws ServletException, IOException {

        out.println("&lt;body&gt;");
<b>        out.println("&lt;h1&gt;Search Customer Information&lt;/h1&gt;");
        String customerNr = request.getParameter("customer_nr");
        if((customerNr != null) && !(customerNr.equals(""))) {

            Customer customer = findByID(new Integer(customerNr));
            if(customer != null){
                out.println("Customer's info for nr. " + customerNr + ": " + customer.getName());
            }else{

            }
        }
        out.println("&lt;form&gt;");
        out.println("Customer number: &lt;input type='text' name='customer_nr' /&gt;");
        out.println("&lt;input type=submit value=Select /&gt;");
        out.println("&lt;/form&gt;");
